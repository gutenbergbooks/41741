<h1>BOUND TO SUCCEED</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>WAKING UP</small></h2>


<p>“Mother, I must do something, and that right
quickly.”</p>

<p>It was Frank Newton who was talking. His
voice was composed, but determined. His face
was calm, but there was a resolute look in his eyes.
It told that under the surface some unusual emotion
was stirring Frank.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can do any more than you
are doing now,” responded his mother with an
anxious sigh. “Of course it seems hard to get
along with so little when we have been used to having
so much. But, oh, Frank, when I think of
what was once&mdash;you away, I knew not where, and
my heart breaking to find out&mdash;I am grateful
and happy, and so very proud of you, my dear,
dear boy.”</p>

<p>Frank’s lip quivered at the fervent words spoken.
They inspired him with their eloquence. His hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
trembled as it rested on his mother’s arm gently
and lovingly.</p>

<p>“It’s worth everything to have you talk that
way, mother,” he said in quite a husky voice, “and
kind words and good opinion just makes me the
more resolved to better things.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be ungrateful or complaining, my boy.”</p>

<p>“It’s never that, mother.”</p>

<p>“And don’t be too ambitious, or too reckless.
We have a roof to shield us and food to eat, thanks
to your busy endeavors. The lawyer gives us
hopes that we may recover something from the
wreck of our lost fortune. I don’t know of any
better outlook for the present, than to wait patiently
and see what turns up in the way of an improvement
in affairs.”</p>

<p>Frank shook his head, and paced up and down
the floor of the best room of the cozy little cottage
that was their present home.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, mother,” he said finally. “The
lost fortune is a dream, a bubble. We may just as
well get down to that. Mr. Beach, the lawyer,
gives us hopes, but they are not based on much.
At the same time, he takes his fees. We can’t
stand that any longer. I told him so, yesterday.
I don’t believe there is the least show in the world
for our claim. I am sure that Mr. Beach shares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
my opinion now. No,” continued Frank definitely,
“what future there is for us must be worked out by
our own independent exertions.”</p>

<p>“It is a bitter wrong then,” spoke his mother.
“When your father, Mr. Newton, died, he left me
his town property here. When I married a second
time, and Mr. Ismond became your stepfather,
I had implicit confidence in him at first. He got
me to sign the property over to him. Then I saw
my mistake. When his tyrannical ways drove you
away from home I lost all regard for him.”</p>

<p>“He certainly was very cruel and unjust to me,”
murmured Frank, recalling many dark days of his
young life.</p>

<p>“When he died,” resumed Frank’s mother, “I
was amazed to find that all my rights to the estate
were forfeited. It looked very much as though
Mr. Ismond had been planning to rob us of everything
when death overtook him. A man named
Purnell, Gideon Purnell, held the title to our property
under mortgage and sale. He sold it to Abner
Dorsett, who now holds it. The law says Dorsett
was an innocent purchaser, and therefore cannot
be disturbed.”</p>

<p>“Innocent!” flashed out Frank. “Oh, what a
shame! Why, we know better than that, mother.
We are sure that Purnell was his tool and partner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Anyhow, we cannot hold Dorsett to make any restitution.
I hope some day, though, to run across
this Purnell. If I ever do, I’ll not lose sight of
him till I know the truth of the wicked plot that
made us paupers. He, and he only, holds the key
to the situation.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dorsett is a bad man,” said the widow.
“His actions show he is not just. Else, why does
he care to put obstacles in your way when you seek
work? I wish we could leave Greenville, Frank.
That man terrifies me. He may get you into some
trouble. I have seen him prowling around here
often. Then, the other day, our poor, faithful
dog, Christmas, disappeared. That same night I
saw Dorsett crouching under the window yonder.
It looks as if he fears something we may know or
do, and is lurking around eavesdropping to find out
what it is.”</p>

<p>“He will find a trap set for him the next time
he comes nosing around here,” declared Frank
with a grim-set lip. “Mother, don’t worry your
mind any further, I am determined to get steady
work and earn more money. I wish, too, we could
leave Greenville. If it was any use I would stay
and fight Dorsett to the last ditch. It’s no use, and
I know it. Let us get out of the sight and memory
of the old life. I’m going to strike out new.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“But how, what at?” inquired Mrs. Ismond
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet, I will before another sun
rises, though,” asserted Frank, staunchly. “That
is, if good hard thinking can suggest the right way
to go about it.”</p>

<p>Frank took up his cap and walked from the
house. He paused to place a silver fifty cent piece
on the kitchen dresser. He had earned it before
breakfast, cutting a lawn and trimming hedges up
at Judge Bascom’s place.</p>

<p>Frank had been doing such odd jobs about town
for the past four months. He was courteous,
accommodating and energetic. Everybody he
worked for liked him, and he never shirked an honest
task.</p>

<p>He made out fairly well as a general utility boy
about the village. The worst of it was, however,
that his good luck came in streaks. One very busy
week Frank made over ten dollars. Then the next
week all he could get to do was chopping wood at
fifty cents a day.</p>

<p>“There is something better in me than that,”
Frank resolved. “I’ve got the problem to solve
what it is, and I feel that it is up to me to figure it
out right now.”</p>

<p>Frank’s face clouded slightly as he crossed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
yard and his eye fell on an empty dog house. It
made Frank feel lonesome and worried to realize
that its former tenant, the dog, Christmas, was
missing.</p>

<p>The faithful animal, a veritable chum to Frank,
had disappeared one night. Frank had spent two
days looking for him with no results.</p>

<p>Christmas was a connecting link between the
present and a very vivid section of the past in Frank
Newton’s experience. The thought of this instantly
sent Frank’s mind drifting among the vital
and exciting incidents in that career.</p>

<p>Frank was a peculiar boy. He had great sturdiness
of character, what some people call “nerve,”
and up to two years before our story begins had led
a happy, joyous existence. He had been an active
spirit, and always a leader in boyish sports and fun.</p>

<p>It had been a black day for Frank when his
mother had married Ismond. Too late Mrs. Newton
had learned that she had wedded a fortune-hunter.
Too soon Frank discovered that the miserable
schemer planned to drive him away from
home, so he might more easily rob the lad’s mother
of her fortune.</p>

<p>Frank stood Ismond’s abuse just as long as he
could. Then he ran away from home.</p>

<p>At first he followed a circus, tired of it, and got a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
job tending a lemonade stand at an ocean resort.
He made all sorts of acquaintances, good and bad.
The latter did not demoralize him, but they did
harden him. He grew to be a cynical, unhappy
boy.</p>

<p>In his wanderings Frank brought up at a town
called Pleasantville. This was the home of Bart
Stirling, the hero of another volume of this series,
“Bart Stirling’s Road to Success,” and of Darry
and Bob Haven, whose stirring careers my former
readers have followed in the volume entitled,
“Working Hard to Win.”</p>

<p>Frank arrived at Pleasantville in the company
of two men, who had devised a great fraud upon
the meanest but richest man in the place, Colonel
Harrington. In disgust of their swindling ways,
Frank destroyed the papers they hoped to impose
upon the colonel. In escaping from them
he was severely crippled and laid up for several
weeks.</p>

<p>Soon his money gave out. He was turned away
from the village hotel for not paying his board.</p>

<p>He proved a boy of ready resources, however.
Bob Haven formed his acquaintance in the midst
of one of his original and daring schemes for raising
money quickly.</p>

<p>Frank paid up his debts and hung around Pleasantville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
living upon his surplus. He was at a
stage of his career where he was sick of change and
adventures. He longed for home. In the friendship
of the Haven boys and Bart Stirling, he began
slowly to feel his way back to a natural boyhood
plane.</p>

<p>One night a terrible fire burned down the Pleasantville
Hotel. It needed just such an incident to
rouse up in Frank the latent chivalry and courage
of his fine soul. At the risk of his life he saved
fourteen inmates penned up in the burning attic of
the hotel, by helping them across a plank leading
into an adjoining building. He braved death
again by going back into the roaring flames to save
a little sleeping child.</p>

<p>Frank rescued the child, but at fearful cost. He
was dreadfully burned, almost blinded. For weeks
he lay at the town hospital, hovering betwixt life
and death. When he finally recovered, it was to
learn that the town had gone wild over his heroism.
In the paper they owned called the <i>Pleasantville
Weekly Herald</i>, the Haven boys had given him “a
write up” that had thrilled the community.</p>

<p>More than that, Frank’s friends had learned
that the name they had known him by, Percy St.
Clair, was an assumed one. They accidentally discovered
his real name, sent word to his native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
town, and when the injured hero awoke to health
again it was to find his devoted mother at his side,
nursing him.</p>

<p>Frank now learned that he was some good in
the world, after all. The ovation of the grateful
and enthusiastic town folks, the loyal, hearty
friendship of such comrades as Bart Stirling and
Darry and Bob Haven warmed his heart to some
of its old-time cheer and courage. The day he left
Pleasantville with his mother for their home at
Greenville, Frank Newton stepped over the threshold
of a new life.</p>

<p>An episode of Frank’s departure was the acquisition
of Christmas. This faithful canine Bart Stirling
had adopted when he was homeless. Haven
Brothers had later employed him to run the pony
press in their amateur job printing office. Frank
loved dogs, and Christmas had taken a great fancy
to him.</p>

<p>The animal whined and ran after Frank when he
set out for the train. Frank drove Christmas
back, but it was only to find the loyal dog hidden
under the car seat, twenty miles on the homeward
trip.</p>

<p>When they reached Greenville, Frank wrote
about Christmas to his Pleasantville friends. His
letter, however, showed his half-hidden reluctancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
towards giving up the faithful old dog. Haven
Brothers made Frank a present of Christmas by
return mail.</p>

<p>Of all this Frank now thought as he made his
way towards the business centre of Greenville.</p>

<p>“Hey there, Frank Newton, the very fellow!”</p>

<p>Frank looked up quickly. A rapid voice had interrupted
his reverie. Its owner was a Mr. Buckner,
a local insurance agent and real estate man.</p>

<p>Mr. Buckner’s office sided on the street where
Frank was walking. From its open window the
proprietor beckoned animatedly.</p>

<p>“Want me?” called up Frank.</p>

<p>“Sure, if you can hustle,” retorted Mr. Buckner.</p>

<p>“I can always do that if there’s anything in it,”
was the laughing rejoinder.</p>

<p>Frank crossed the street at a bound, darted
around to the front of the building, and was up the
stairs four steps at a time.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>A FIVE-DOLLAR JOB</small></h2>


<p>Frank found Mr. Buckner at his desk, tearing
out a freshly-written slip from his check book.</p>

<p>“Good&mdash;sit down,” said the business man.
“Ready in a second. Now then,” he added a
minute later, after filling out a receipt blank, “want
to make five dollars?”</p>

<p>“A week?” smiled Frank.</p>

<p>“A day&mdash;an hour, if you can get the action on
this job that quick,” responded Buckner briskly.
“See here, Frank,” he continued, consulting his
watch, “a certain individual started down that
south road yonder in his buggy for Riverton half-an-hour
ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” nodded Frank.</p>

<p>“How soon can he get there?”</p>

<p>“Horse any good?” questioned Frank.</p>

<p>“No, common every-day hack.”</p>

<p>“Well,” calculated Frank, “it’s fifteen miles
around by that road. Taking it fairly easy, he’d
get to Riverton in about two hours and a-half.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very good,” said Buckner. “Can you do it
in less time?”</p>

<p>“On foot?”</p>

<p>“Any way, so you get there.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Frank confidently. “I can make
it in an hour by crossing the flats.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” observed Buckner, “I see.”</p>

<p>“Direct across the swamp stretch it is barely six
miles to Riverton,” went on Frank.</p>

<p>“But there’s no road?”</p>

<p>“Except the trail us boys have blazed out from
time to time,” explained Frank, his eyes brightening
at the memory of many a famous camping out
experience in “the Big Woods.” “I can bike it
four miles, wade one, and there’s only an easy mile
stretch to come after that.”</p>

<p>“U-um,” muttered Mr. Buckner in a musing
tone, half to himself. “I’d rather not excite the
suspicions of a certain person already on the road,
so your suggestion strikes me very good, Frank.
Will you guarantee to get to Riverton first?”</p>

<p>“I will&mdash;with time to spare,” promised Frank,
readily.</p>

<p>“I rely on you, then. It is quite an important
matter. Here is a check for two hundred dollars.
It is made payable to James Pryor. He is a fire insurance
adjuster at Riverton, with an office over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
bank there. You find him out, hand him that
check, get him to sign this receipt, and your work
is done.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy,” said Frank with a pleasant smile.
“It isn’t worth five dollars, though.”</p>

<p>“I’m doing this hiring,” retorted Buckner with
a quizzical laugh. “Client’s money, see? By the
way, too, do this little commission up trim and neat,
and there will be some more work for you from the
same party.”</p>

<p>Frank was mightily pleased at his task and the
prospects. He stowed the check and receipt in a
safe pocket, and started to leave the office.</p>

<p>“My client wants to buy up some salvage from
a fire at Riverton,” Mr. Buckner explained.</p>

<p>“I see,” nodded Frank.</p>

<p>“A certain party here has been juggling with
the situation. He put in a lot of dummy bids.
We learned what his best bid was, and offered the
same amount. Just now we got a letter&mdash;as he
did also&mdash;accepting first payment from either of
us. By the way, too,” continued Mr. Buckner,
with a queer twinkle in his eye, “when you come to
find who it is you have helped to outwit, you may
experience a decided personal pleasure in the discovery.
Report soon as you get back to Greenville,
Frank.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“That will be one o’clock at the latest,” pledged
the boy.</p>

<p>He glanced at the clock, and was down the
stairs quicker than he had come up them. Frank
was back home in a jiffy. He made a brief explanation
to his mother. Getting out his bicycle
he tied to the handles a pair of long rubber boots.
Soon he was sailing down the road to the south.</p>

<p>The Big Woods formed a long six-mile barrier
between Greenville and Riverton direct. Its centre
was practically impassible during wet seasons. It
was a dismal, slushy waste. For this reason the
only road to Riverton wound in a semi-circle many
miles out of the natural course.</p>

<p>Frank entered the woods at a familiar opening
near the edge of the town. For two miles there
was a hard trodden path, and he made good time
on his wheel. For two more, he had to pick a
straggling course. Many times he had to dismount
from the bicycle and run it past obstacles.
However, it was not long before he reached the
edge of the flats.</p>

<p>“Capital!” said Frank, after an eager survey
of the swampy stretch. “I couldn’t strike it drier.
Now then, for a wade.”</p>

<p>Frank ran his bicycle to cover, and drew on the
long rubber boots. For a distance of a quarter-of-a-mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
he made ready progress by stepping from
one dried-up clump of grass or reeds to another.
He had to pick his course more particularly, however,
as he got to the wet spots. Wading was not
difficult, as the water was not deep. Only once did
Frank sink above the knees.</p>

<p>“Whew! that was a hot tug,” panted the youth,
as he reached the west slope of the flats.</p>

<p>Frank threw himself flat on dry ground and
rested for five minutes. Then he arose and removed
the rubber boots. He hid these among
some bushes and resumed his travels at a lively gait.</p>

<p>Presently Frank was passing the vicinity of a
board fence. It reached up fully fifteen feet, and
its top was studded with sharp-pointed nails.
Frank was not near enough to observe it more than
casually. He had no time to make a closer inspection,
and, past a reach of timber, it was shut out
entirely from his view.</p>

<p>“Hello!” again he exclaimed a few minutes
later, and paused this time to look across a ditch.
An object of decided curiosity and interest held
Frank’s attention. This was a little ragged urchin
curled up fast asleep against a clump of dry weeds.</p>

<p>He was barefooted, and up to the knees he was
spattered and caked with dry mud. His face
was dust-covered, tired-looking and tear-stained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Frank’s sympathy was easily aroused. He voted
the little fellow some wretched, homeless lad on a
tramp.</p>

<p>By the side of the boy was quite a large bundle.
It was enclosed in a newspaper. The breeze blew
the sheets aside and the contents were disclosed
quite readily to Frank’s view.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Frank, his eyes opening wide,
“he’s not a vegetarian, that’s sure.”</p>

<p>The remark was called forth by a sight of a mass
of cold cooked meat that might well make Frank
stare, on account of its volume and variety. It
looked as if the young wayfarer had gathered up a
lunch for many days. There were parts of mutton
chops, chunks of roast beef, and cuts of pork,
flanked by bones and remnants of hash and sausages.</p>

<p>“Hope he’s here when I come back this way,”
said Frank. “Looks pretty forelorn. I’d be
glad to give him a lift.”</p>

<p>Frank hurried forward now. He soon reached
the outskirts of Riverton. Within ten minutes he
gained the business centre of the little town.
Frank located the bank. He was soon at the door
of an office over it bearing the words in gilt letters:</p>

<p class="noic"><i>James Pryor, Fire Insurance.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>The door was open. Seated behind a wire railing
at a desk was a cross-looking old man writing
in a book. Frank approached him with the question.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Pryor in?”</p>

<p>“Eleven,” snapped out the man without looking
up from his work.</p>

<p>“You mean he will be here at eleven o’clock?”
pursued Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait for him then,” said Frank, selecting
a chair. He felt a trifle disappointed and worried.
The “certain other party” was on the road to
Riverton. It was part of Frank’s contract to see
Pryor before his arrival.</p>

<p>Several people came in and inquired for the insurance
man during the next half-hour. Some of
them went away saying they would return at eleven
o’clock. Some others sat down like Frank, and
waited. Frank heard the old clerk explain to one
caller that Mr. Pryor was in his private room, but
engaged in a most important consultation with a
client.</p>

<p>Frank grew restless. He approached the cross-grained
clerk again.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” he said politely, “but I understand
that Mr. Pryor is in his private room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“What of it? Can’t be disturbed,” snapped
out his representative.</p>

<p>Frank retreated. He managed to endure a further
tedious wait of a quarter-of-an-hour. Finally
he strolled to the window looking down on the
street.</p>

<p>“That ‘other party’ is on his way here,” mused
Frank anxiously. “Suppose he gets here before
eleven o’clock? That gives him an even chance
with myself. Oh, the mischief!” exclaimed Frank
suddenly. “Now the pot’s in the fire, sure!”</p>

<p>Frank gave a great start, and stared fixedly at a
horse and gig that came clattering to a stop just
then in front of the bank.</p>

<p>Frank recognized the vehicle and its driver. As
he did so, he as quickly guessed that this new arrival
must be the “certain party” alluded to by
Mr. Buckner.</p>

<p>The new comer was Abner Dorsett, the man who
had helped to swindle Frank’s mother out of her
fortune.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>A BUSINESS CALL</small></h2>


<p>Frank watched Dorsett dismount from the gig
and tie his horse. He realized that he would be
up into the insurance man’s office in a few minutes.</p>

<p>“I must do something, and quickly,” thought
Frank. “The second that man sees me he will
suspect my mission here. He is a person of substance,
and will carry weight. I shall be left if he
gets into action first.”</p>

<p>Frank reflected rapidly. The old clerk, as he
had already found out, was unapproachable.
Frank was seized with a wild impulse to leap over
the wire railing and rush past the clerk to the door
of Mr. Pryor’s private office.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s locked, though,” said Frank.
“No, I won’t do that. I don’t see that I can do
much of anything, except to wait and take my
chance of getting the check into Mr. Pryor’s hands
before Mr. Dorsett guesses what’s up.”</p>

<p>Frank glanced at the clock. It showed ten minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to eleven. He went out into the hall and drew
back into the shelter of a big fuel box there.</p>

<p>Dorsett came up the stairs, buggy whip in hand.
He bustled into the office in his usual self-important
way. Frank noticed that the old clerk sat
down on him promptly. He was not one bit impressed
with the bombastic visitor from Greenville.</p>

<p>Dorsett scowled as the clerk pointed to the clock,
and impatiently fumbling the whip, sat down with
the others in the office to await the royal pleasure
of its closeted proprietor.</p>

<p>Frank did a lot of thinking. He planned all
kinds of wild dashes when the door of that private
office should open. Then, happening to stroll
down the hall, a new idea was suggested to him.</p>

<p>“Would it win?” Frank breathlessly asked himself.</p>

<p>He had come out on a little landing. This was
that platform of stairs running down into the rear
of the lot that the bank and the insurance office occupied.</p>

<p>Six feet away from it to the left were two windows.
They were both open. The low hum of
voices reached Frank’s ears. Judging from the
situation of the apartment beyond, Frank was sure
that he had located the insurance man’s private
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder if I dare?” he challenged himself.
“I wonder if it would work?”</p>

<p>His eyes snapped and his fingers tingled. Then
Frank studied the outlook more carefully. He
calculated first his chances of getting to the first
window. He also planned just what he would say
in the way of explanation and apology once he
reached it.</p>

<p>Two feet away from the platform a lightning
rod ran straight up the building. Frank seized
this. He fearlessly swung himself free of the platform,
bracing his toes on a protending joint of the
rod.</p>

<p>At the side of the nearest window, top and bottom,
were two hinge standards. They had been
imbedded in the solid masonry when the place was
built to hold iron shutters, if such were ever needed.
The bank floor below was guarded with these, but
none had been put in place on the upper story.</p>

<p>Frank swung one hand free, and bending to a
rather risky angle hooked a forefinger around the
upper one of these standards. At the same time
he gave his body a swing clear of his footing.</p>

<p>He aimed to land his feet on the sill of the nearest
window. In this Frank succeeded. There was
no time, however, to chance losing the foothold
thus gained. He promptly slid his free hand down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
under the frame of the raised window. He got a
firm clutch. Relaxing his hold of the hinge standard,
he stooped.</p>

<p>The next moment, on a decidedly reckless and
awkward balance, Frank tumbled rather than
dropped inside of the room that was his objective
point of assault.</p>

<p>“Hello! what’s this?” instantly hailed him.</p>

<p>Frank nimbly gained an upright position. He
faced two men who, seated at a table covered with
papers, began to push back their chairs in a somewhat
startled way. They stared hard at the intruder.</p>

<p>Frank promptly doffed his cap. He made his
most courteous bow.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, gentlemen,” he said in a rather
flustrated way, “but which is Mr. Pryor, please?”</p>

<p>“I am Pryor,” answered one of the twain, and
Frank saw from the gathering frown on the speaker’s
face that a storm was brewing unless he headed
it off summarily.</p>

<p>“I must beg your pardon, Mr. Pryor,” said
Frank, “but it is a matter of some business importance.
I have been waiting for over an hour
to see you. It won’t take but a moment, sir,” and
Frank swiftly produced the check and the receipt
entrusted to him by Mr. Buckner. Before Pryor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
realized it, they were thrust into his hands and he
was looking at them.</p>

<p>“Oh, this can wait,” he said pettishly. “I
don’t like this kind of an intrusion, young man.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, Mr. Pryor,” interrupted
Frank in a gentle, polite tone, “but I am only a
paid messenger, and I promised Mr. Buckner to
be back with that receipt at a certain time.”</p>

<p>“So you seized the bull by the horns,” broke in
Pryor’s companion with a great chuckle. “And
outwitted old Grumper, the clerk, ha! ha! Pryor,
nail the boy on a year’s contract. He’s got the
making in him of a first-class insurance solicitor,
in his originality, daring and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cheek,” muttered Pryor. “Well, well&mdash;here’s
your receipt.”</p>

<p>Frank seized the paper that Pryor signed with
a swift scrawl of the pen, with an eagerness that
was a kind of delighted rapture.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, sir,” he said, “and a thousand
apologies for my rude intrusion.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” ordered Pryor, as Frank returned
towards the window.</p>

<p>“Yes, unless you carry extra accident insurance,”
put in Pryor’s companion. “You might not find
it so easy getting out of that window as you did getting
in, young fellow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Pryor had gone to the clouded glass door,
which Frank knew opened into the main office.
He slipped its catch and opened it. Frank understood
that he was to pass out that way. He started
forward, making a deferential bow to his host.</p>

<p>“Hi, I say, Pryor&mdash;one minute!” sounded a
voice in the outer office, and Frank wondered what
was about to happen as he recognized the tones as
belonging to Dorsett.</p>

<p>“In a few minutes,” responded Pryor, with an
impatient wave of his hand.</p>

<p>“All right. It’s about the salvage business, you
know,” went on Dorsett from behind the wire grating.
“Want to pay you the money and close up
the deal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that?” spoke Pryor, with a sudden glance
at Frank and a grim twinkle in his eyes. “You
young schemer!” he said to Frank in an undertone,
with a slight chuckle. “I understand your peculiar
tactics, now. You’ll do, decidedly, young
man!”</p>

<p>Frank tried to look all due humility, but he
could not entirely suppress a satisfied smile. As he
passed out Pryor said to Dorsett: “You are too
late on that matter. I have just closed the salvage
business with Buckner of Greenville.”</p>

<p>“You’ve what?” howled Dorsett, with a violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
start. “Why, I’m here first. No one passed
me on the road. I&mdash;er, hum”&mdash;Dorsett turned
white as his eye fell on Frank. He glared and
shook his driving whip.</p>

<p>The animated and interested friend of Pryor
stuck his head past the open doorway.</p>

<p>“I say, youngster,” he asked guardedly, his face
all a-grin, “how did you circumvent the old
chap?”</p>

<p>“Well, I nearly swam part of the way,” explained
Frank. “Thank you, Mr. Pryor,” he
added, as the latter opened the wire gate for him
to pass out.</p>

<p>The old clerk had sprung to his feet, gaping in
consternation at him. Pryor’s friend was convulsed
with internal mirth. Pryor himself did
not look altogether displeased at the situation.</p>

<p>Frank thought that Dorsett would actually leap
upon him and strike him with the whip. The latter,
however, with a hoarse growl in his throat, allowed
Frank to proceed on his way unhindered.</p>

<p>“We shall hear from this of course&mdash;my
mother and I,” said the youth to himself as he
gained the street. “Mr. Dorsett will store this
up against me, hard. All right&mdash;I’ve done my
simple duty and I’ll stand by the results.”</p>

<p>A minute later, looking back the way he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
come, Frank saw Dorsett come threshing out into
the street. He kicked a dog out of his path, rudely
jostled a pedestrian, jumped into the gig and went
tearing down the homeward road plying the whip
and venting his cruel rage on the poor animal in
the shafts.</p>

<p>Frank started back towards Greenville the way
he had come. He was greatly pleased at his success,
and cheeringly anticipated the good the five
dollars would do his mother and himself.</p>

<p>As Frank passed the spot where he had noticed
the barefooted, mud-bespattered urchin lying asleep
by the side of the ditch, he could find no trace of the
lad.</p>

<p>A little farther on Frank came in sight of the
high board fence he had so curiously observed on
his way to Riverton.</p>

<p>The wind was his way, and as he approached the
queer barrier he was somewhat astonished at a great
babel of canine barking and howls that greeted his
ears.</p>

<p>“Sounds like a kennel,” he reflected, “but’s a
big one. Why, if there isn’t the little fellow with
the package of meat.”</p>

<p>Frank wonderingly regarded a tattered, forlorn
figure at a distance seeming to be glued right up
face forward against the fence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy had piled two or three big boulders on
top of one another. These he had surmounted,
and was peering through a high up crack or knot
hole in the fence.</p>

<p>On one arm he carried the newspaper package
Frank had noticed. Bit by bit he poised its contents,
hurling them over the fence.</p>

<p>A loud clamor of yelps and barkings would
greet this shower of food. Frank drew nearer,
mightily interested.</p>

<p>The little fellow would throw over a bone and
peer inside the enclosure.</p>

<p>“Get it, Fido!” Frank heard him shout.
“They won’t let him&mdash;those big ones,” he wailed.
“Oh, you dear, big fellow, help him, help him.
No, they won’t let him. Fido, Fido, Oh, my! oh
my!”</p>

<p>The little fellow slipped down to a seat on the
boulders now and began to cry as if his heart would
break. Frank approached and pulled at his arm.</p>

<p>“Hi, youngster,” he challenged, “what in the
world are you up to, anyhow?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>A BREAK FOR LIBERTY</small></h2>


<p>The little ragamuffin addressed by Frank raised
his dirt-creased, tear-stained face pathetically. He
looked at his questioner for a moment and then
went on crying harder than ever.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Frank, “this is a queer go.
Come, little son, brace up and tell what is the matter
with you. Who is Fido&mdash;a dog?”</p>

<p>“Sure. He’s in there, he’s been in there for
two days now, and I cannot get him out.”</p>

<p>“There appears to be a good many dogs in
there, judging from the racket,” said Frank.
“What kind of a place is this, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“It’s the pound,” explained the urchin. “Belongs
to Riverton, but Sile Stoggs runs it. Know
Stoggs?”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” answered Frank.</p>

<p>“He’s a brute&mdash;Oh, what a brute!” cried the
little fellow. “Was a constable&mdash;the mean kind.
Turned a poor woman out of her house in the cold
last winter. She died, and her two big brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
met Stoggs one dark night and nearly kicked the
life out of him. He had to give up business, for
they crippled him.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” encouraged Frank.</p>

<p>“He had some pol&mdash;politicattle friends, I
think they call it. One of them was a sharp lawyer.
He raked up a lot of old ord&mdash;ordinants.”</p>

<p>“Ordinances, I suppose you mean?” suggested
Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, that sounds more like it,&mdash;anyway,
village laws, see? They said Riverton should have
a pound. They worked it so that Stoggs got the
job of poundmaster. The town pays him a big
rent for these old barracks. Used to be a trotting
park. He drives around in a little dog cart, and
picks up all the stray horses and cows he can catch.
Then the owners have to pay two dollars to get
them out of the pound. Stoggs gets half. Wish
that was Stogg,” and the boy kicked a dirt clump so
hard that he stubbed his toe and winced.</p>

<p>“And what about the dogs?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“That’s a new wrinkle. About a month ago
Stoggs’ lawyer fished up another old law about dog
license, or tax, or something of that kind. Since
then he’s been capturing all the dogs he could find
for miles around. It wouldn’t matter, if he was
kind to them,” went on the lad, “but he isn’t. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
starves them. He beats them, too awfully.
And you’d ought to see the dirty old water trough
where he makes them drink. Mother is poor.
We can’t pay any two dollars to get Fido out. But
I come here every day and bring all the meat I can
gather up, and feed the poor things. The trouble
is, though, there is so many of them in there, and
they are so hungry, and poor Fido is so small, he
hardly ever gets a nibble. There’s a grand, big
dog in there looks out for him when he can, and
divides a bone with him, but the rough dogs get
most of the food.”</p>

<p>“Have you tried to get this Stoggs to let you
have Fido back?” inquired Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he only abused me, laughed at me, and
drove me away. Yesterday he caught me trying to
dig that board loose near the boulders. He kicked
me, and struck me twice with his club. Wish I
had a shovel. It would be safe to dig a bit now.
A big balloon went over here a little while ago. I
saw Stoggs in his cart driving over to the hill to get
a better sight of it.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” mused Frank. “Quite an interesting
situation. I’ll take a look inside there, I guess.
Hey, hello, why&mdash;Christmas!”</p>

<p>Frank, in mingled pleasure and astonishment,
fairly shouted out this name. The minute he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
mounted the boulders and peered in through the
crack in the fence, he made out his own missing
canine among a motley group of over forty dogs.</p>

<p>Slam! came an instantaneous bound against the
fence that made it quiver and creak. Slam&mdash;slam!
right up to the spot where Frank had uttered
the name, Christmas sprang repeatedly. He was
mad with joy and excitement at recognizing his
young master’s voice.</p>

<p>Frank was now quite as much stirred up as his
youthful companion. He had to call to Christmas
to reassure and quiet the animal. The dog
was tearing at the fence barrier in such a frenzied
manner that Frank feared he would severely injure
himself.</p>

<p>“How did Christmas ever get this far away
from home?” he reflected, getting off the boulders
and onto the ground again. “Say, if that Stoggs
has gone deliberately out of his territory and caught
him at Greenville, I’ll get the boys to come here
and tar and feather him. Easy, old fellow,”
called Frank to Christmas, who, yelping frantically,
could still be heard throwing himself against
the boards of the fence.</p>

<p>“My goodness!” shouted Frank’s companion,
suddenly. “Look at that, now.”</p>

<p>His eyes goggled as a great snap sounded out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“The mischief!” exclaimed Frank. “This
won’t do.”</p>

<p>Christmas, it seemed, had flung his body with
terrific force against the very plank where the
owner of Fido had been digging. Its ground end
was soaked and rotted by the damp earth that had
surrounded it. It gave, vibrating, and Christmas
forced his head and shoulders through the aperture.
He wriggled and howled, for the board
closed on him like a wedge. Then, making a desperate
lunge, the dog bore the board outwards.
There was a sharp snap. Obliquely the timber
ripped four feet up its length.</p>

<p>Bursting the slivered section fully apart, Christmas,
with a joyous howl, sprang free. He
bounded upon his master in frantic delight, with
such impetuosity that he bore Frank flat to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Here, behave, old fellow. Well, I’m glad,
too,” said Frank. “For mercy’s sake!”</p>

<p>With difficulty restraining the wild caresses of
his loyal dumb friend, Frank regained his feet to
stare about him in consternation.</p>

<p>Christmas had blazed the way to freedom, and
a vast concourse was following his lead. It was
like bees pouring out from a bee hive. Through
the break in the fence there came bounding what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
seemed to be an endless procession. There were
big dogs and little dogs, mastiffs, fox terriers and
collies. One magnificent St. Bernard got wedged
in the fence break. Those behind fairly pushed
him through, letting loose a stream of canines like
corn from a spout.</p>

<p>Out bounded the released animals, fairly crazy
with delight at finding their freedom. Nearly all
of them instantly made for a near ditch filled with
clear water. They lapped it up luxuriously, they
rolled and wallowed in the pure, cool element.
Then, like diverging spokes from one central
source, they streaked it homewards as instinct told
them their proper compass point.</p>

<p>The little ragged urchin Frank found seated on
the ground, fondling and crying over the tiniest,
silken-haired poodle he had ever seen. Its own affectionate
antics were fairly affecting. Beside the
pair, limping on three legs, a forlorn little fox-terrier
looked homelessly and friendlessly longing,
as if begging for a share of attention.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll take you, too!” cried the ragged
youngster, putting Fido under one arm and gathering
up the crippled canine in the other. “Say,”
he shouted to Frank, “you’re a brick! Oh, but
you’ve done a good day’s work. Thank you,
thank you, thank you! Only, get now&mdash;don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
wait. If Stoggs catches us, he’ll send us to jail
for life. Why,” continued the urchin with a start,
staring hard at Christmas, “is that your dog?”</p>

<p>“It is,” nodded Frank.</p>

<p>The little fellow stooped and deliberately kissed
Christmas, his eyes full of grateful tears, purring
out fond terms of endearment.</p>

<p>“You’re two grand fellows!” he blubbered.
“That’s the dog that was such a good friend to
Fido,” and Fido, whimpering, struck out his
head and rubbed noses with Christmas, who frolicked
around all hands as if some great jubilee was
going on.</p>

<p>“Yes, I fancy we had better be moving on,” said
Frank, with a glance into the enclosure to find it
entirely deserted by its recent inmates.</p>

<p>“About your dog, though,” said his companion,
hurriedly. “I can tell you something about
him.”</p>

<p>“Can you, indeed?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I was here the day a man drove up
in a gig from Riverton-way with your dog.”</p>

<p>“In a gig?” repeated Frank, pricking up his
ears.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was hanging around near the house at
the front of the pound. The man called Stoggs
out. He had your dog tied behind the axle. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
made a bargain with Stoggs for five dollars to get
rid of the animal&mdash;send him away somewhere.
He was a man with reddish side-whiskers and a cast
in one eye.”</p>

<p>Frank’s own good eyes flamed. He drew his
breath with an angry catch in it.</p>

<p>“Dorsett,” he said. “The villain did it, eh?
I wondered how poor Christmas came to be cooped
up here, so far away from home. The mean
sneak! He did it so he could snoop around the
house and spy on us without interruption. Going?
Good-bye. I hope you will keep Fido safe
and sound from the dogcatchers this time.”</p>

<p>“You bet I will,” cried the little fellow, bolting
off with his double canine burden. “And you’re
a brick!”</p>

<p>Frank turned his face in the direction of home.
He soon got out of sight of the pound with no indication
of his having been seen or pursued.
Christmas bounded over the fresh turf, cutting up
all kinds of antics and barking joyously.</p>

<p>When they reached the flats Frank secured his
rubber boots and was soon in the midst of the morass.
Christmas led the way, making grand fun of
leaps and dousings, and they reached the woods beyond
with no mishap.</p>

<p>Frank drew his bicycle from the spot where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
had hidden it, secured his rubber boots to the machine,
and was speedily threading the path he had
traversed in the opposite direction earlier in the
day.</p>

<p>Passing down a gentle declivity in an open space,
Christmas set up a sudden bark. Frank turned, to
observe the dog halted and looking aloft.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Frank, also glancing skywards.
“That must be the balloon the little fellow
at the pound was telling about.”</p>

<p>The balloon was about two miles distant, and
was instantly obscured from view by some tall
trees.</p>

<p>Frank had kept on going without looking ahead.
The momentary distraction had its result.</p>

<p>Too late he turned the handle bars of the bicycle
and set the brake.</p>

<p>Bump! the machine struck a jagged tree stump,
and Frank Newton took a header.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>THE BALLOONIST’S RESCUE</small></h2>


<p>There was a sharp bang as the bicycle struck
the tree stump. Frank righted himself readily and
ran to the machine where it had fallen.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” he exclaimed, “tire punctured and
the wheel a pretty bad wreck generally.”</p>

<p>This was true. A jagged sliver had ripped a
hole in both the outer and inner tubes of the front
wheel. The hard bang against the tree stump had
twisted several spokes out of place and set a rim
wobbling.</p>

<p>Frank had started in such a hurry from Riverton
that morning that he had not thought of taking his
mending kit along. He debated what he should
do without further loss of time.</p>

<p>“I might carry it,” he reflected. “If I try to
run it, I will loosen it up more and lose some of
the parts. Guess I’ll leave it here, get my message
to Mr. Buckner, stop at the house for my
tool kit, and fix the machine up right here. This
way, my staunch and trusty friend,” he hailed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Christmas. “Watch it, old fellow, watch it,”
said Frank to the dog, placing his hand on the
wheel.</p>

<p>Christmas looked longingly after his young master
as Frank started on foot for Greenville. However,
the animal posed right alongside the bicycle.
Frank knew that it would take a loaded cannon to
drive the trusty canine from the vicinity of his
charge until he himself reappeared and gave the
word.</p>

<p>It was just one o’clock when Frank, a trifle
dusty and footsore, entered the office of Mr. Buckner.</p>

<p>“Well, well, good for you, Frank,” commended
the insurance man, as he glanced at the clock and
then at his visitor’s beaming face. “Of course
you succeeded?”</p>

<p>“I did,” admitted Frank, a little proudly, “but
there was a tangle.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Dorsett was on the spot. There is
the receipt. I had to climb for it.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Frank told of the circumstances of his exploit
at Mr. Pryor’s office at Riverton. Mr. Buckner
lay back in his chair chuckling and laughing.
Then he got up and clapped Frank approvingly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the shoulder with one hand, and with the other
extended a crisp new five-dollar bill.</p>

<p>“I am glad to get this,” said Frank, “but I
have hardly earned so much, I think.”</p>

<p>“What! when you saved the day by your nimbleness
and square common sense? See here, Frank,
I’m mightily pleased with you, and if you will drop
in here to-morrow I think I can put you in the way
of earning a few more of those precious notes.”</p>

<p>Frank bowed his thanks and left the office with
a light heart. He went straight home, entered the
house quietly, and actually startled his mother by
silently dropping the five-dollar bill on the book
in her lap.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ismond shared her son’s pleasure when
Frank recited his brisk experiences of the morning.
He ate a good lunch with appetizing vigor, secured
his bicycle repair kit, and was soon down the
road, whistling cheerily all the way to the big
woods.</p>

<p>As Frank neared the spot where he had left
Christmas and the bicycle, he was greeted with
loud and repeated barking.</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” he mused. “Christmas isn’t
given to such demonstrations when on duty. Some
one must have come in sight or hearing. Hey, old
fellow, what’s all this rumpus?” questioned Frank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
as, emerging from a copse, he came in full view of
the dog.</p>

<p>Christmas was running up and down in front of
the bicycle. He would face in a certain direction
and pose and bark. He even ran up to his master
as Frank approached, and seizing his coat in
his teeth gently but resolutely pulled him in the direction
he had pointed.</p>

<p>“He means something by all this,” declared
Frank. “Go ahead,” he ordered.</p>

<p>Christmas, thus advised, bounded forward
among some big trees. Frank, coming up with
him after a jaunt of about three hundred feet,
found him squatted on his haunches under a giant
oak tree, looking up among its branches. Frank
looked up, too. A moving object attracted his attention.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Frank, staring fixedly, “it’s a
balloon.”</p>

<p>This he discerned beyond question. He could
plainly make out its slack rigging. An ungainly,
half-distended gas bag was wobbling about in the
topmost branches of the tree. Lower down,
turned sideways and partly smashed in, was a big
wicker basket.</p>

<p>“It must be the balloon that little ragged fellow
told about, the same one that I saw when I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
that header from the bicycle,” decided Frank.
“There couldn’t have been any one in it. Oh, say&mdash;but
there was, Mercy!” and Frank gave a violent
start and quick gasp. He stood transfixed
with a sudden thrilling emotion akin to terror.</p>

<p>His eye sweeping the tree expanse keenly, he
now made out, lying across two limbs about thirty
feet from the ground, a human figure.</p>

<p>This form was motionless, and bent the branches
considerably. As the breeze stirred them, they
rocked like a cradle.</p>

<p>Frank guessed out the situation instantly. The
balloon had driven or dropped into the tree top,
shattering the cage and tipping out its pilot.</p>

<p>The latter had sustained a twenty-foot fall,
striking some big branches with enough force to
stun him. He had landed on his present frail
perch. Frank’s heart almost stood still as he realized
that a single waking moment, a treacherous
shifting of the wind, might precipitate the imperilled
balloonist to the ground with a broken
neck.</p>

<p>Frank’s nerves were on a hard strain, but he
grew composed as he decided what he would do.
He motioned the dog to silence, and at once started
to climb the tree.</p>

<p>He kept his eye on the swaying figure overhead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
all the time. At length Frank reached a big
crotched branch shooting out from the main trunk
not four feet under that which sustained the unconscious
balloonist.</p>

<p>Frank braced his feet across the crotch. He
took a great, long breath of relief and satisfaction,
for he found himself now so situated that if the
man should stir or slip from his insecure resting
place, he could retard his fall.</p>

<p>Frank had, upon leaving home, placed a long coil
of rope in his coat pocket. This he intended to use
to tie up the bicycle in case he found it necessary
to take it home to repair it. He now used this to
form a criss-cross sort of a hammock directly under
the two branches supporting the balloonist.</p>

<p>“There,” said Frank finally, feeling he had the
man in right shape at last. “If he drops, that
contrivance will hold him like a net.”</p>

<p>The youth rested for a few minutes, for it had
been no easy task to slip the rope around the two
branches and secure it stoutly. When he again
stood up, he moved along his footing so that his
face was on a level with the strange bed of the
balloonist.</p>

<p>The latter lay sunk down among bending twigs
like a person in a hammock. His face was bloodless,
and over one temple was a great lump. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was probably where a heavy branch had struck
and stunned him.</p>

<p>The stranger was fairly well-dressed, and he had
intelligent features. For all this, however, there
was a careless, easy-going look about him. He
did not at all suggest to Frank the quick-witted,
nerve-strained typical aeronaut.</p>

<p>Frank made his footing very sure, braced firmly,
and with one hand took a stout grasp under the
sleeper’s collar.</p>

<p>“Wake up&mdash;wake up,” he called directly in
his ear.</p>

<p>The man stirred faintly, only. Frank continued
to call out to him. He also with his other
hand slapped his chest, his cheeks, his outstretched
palms.</p>

<p>Finally with a deep groan the man opened his
eyes wide suddenly. He stared and mumbled and
tried to start up, but Frank held him flat.</p>

<p>“Easy, mister, now,” warned Frank gently.
“Take time to find out the fix you are in. Then
let me help you to the ground.”</p>

<p>“Help me&mdash;why, ginger! I understand,” exclaimed
the balloonist.</p>

<p>He lay back weakly, staring at Frank, then all
about him, and finally up at the gas bag flopping
about in the upper branches of the tree top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“I remember now,” he went on in a drawling,
reminiscent tone. “It was a quick drop. Valve
blew out. A regular smash when we landed.
She’s a wreck, isn’t she? And say,” and the man
glancing sideways downward shuddered, “if I had
gone the full header it would have been all day
with me, eh?”</p>

<p>Frank nodded. Briefly he explained how he
had come to discover the refugee’s plight. He
helped the man to sit up, guiding and assisting him.
The latter came slowly out of his maze of bewilderment,
and looked grateful.</p>

<p>“You’ve saved me, I guess,” he observed.
“One move or slip, and I’d have gone shooting
down the rest of the way.”</p>

<p>“When you are ready, let me help you to the
ground,” suggested Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right now. Just a little shaking
up,” assured the man. “No, no, don’t you worry.
I’m at home among trapezes.”</p>

<p>The balloonist extricated himself successfully
from the swaying branches and poised in a crotch
nearer to the main trunk of the tree.</p>

<p>“Just a minute,” he said, deftly going up the
tree, clambering over the shattered basket and
reaching up.</p>

<p>There was a great hiss and a dense taint of escaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
gas in the air as he operated some valve
in the mechanism of the balloon. The gas bag
dropped gracefully to a mass of silken and rubber
folds.</p>

<p>Then the man started to descend, Frank preceding
him. Both reached the ground in safety.
The balloonist took an approving look at Frank,
patted Christmas and began arranging his disordered
attire.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do next?” asked
Frank, after his companion had walked around the
tree two or three times, viewing its top speculatively
the while, and whistling softly to himself.</p>

<p>“Well, the bag is safe for a time. I guess I’d
better get to the nearest town and telegraph the
boss. It will be a job getting the balloon out of
that fix without further damage.”</p>

<p>“If you will rest a bit till I fix up a broken bicycle
I have over yonder, I will pilot you to Greenville,”
said Frank.</p>

<p>“Good for you,” commended the man, and he
followed Frank to the spot where the wheel lay.</p>

<p>Frank set at work on the damaged bicycle. He
now had the necessary tools and material at hand to
fix it up. At the end of ten minutes he had the
wheel in safe shape to roll it home, where he could
repair it more permanently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime his companion rattled on volubly.
He told Frank his name was Park Gregson. He
was a sort of a “knockaround.” He had been
with a circus, had fought Indians, had been major
in the South African War, had circumnavigated
the globe twice, in fact, a Jack-of-all-trades and
master of none for over fifteen years.</p>

<p>“That balloon,” he explained, “belongs to a
professional aeronaut. He hired me to help him.
She’s a new one, that yonder. I was making a
trial cruise. Professor Balmer, who owns her, is at
Circleville. As I say, I must wire him to come
and get her on her feet again.”</p>

<p>“You mean her wings?” suggested Frank.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Ready? No, you needn’t help
me, I’m only a trifle bruised and stiff.”</p>

<p>Frank led the way townwards. He stopped at
the house to put his bicycle away. Then he accompanied
his companion to the railroad depot.
Here Park Gregson wrote out a telegram and
handed it to the operator.</p>

<p>“Expect an answer,” he observed. “I’ll call
for it. No, send it to me. I say, Newton,” he
addressed Frank with friendly familiarity,
“where’s the best place to put up till the professor
reports himself?”</p>

<p>“There’s a fairly good hotel here,” said Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Gregson looked a trifle embarrassed for an instant.
Then he laughed, saying.</p>

<p>“They’ll have to take me in penniless till the
professor arrives.”</p>

<p>“That will be all right,” declared Frank. “I’ll
vouch for you. But say, if you would be our
guest at home, you will be very welcome.”</p>

<p>“And I will be very delighted to have your
most entertaining company,” instantly replied
Gregson. “I’ll make it all right when the boss
comes.”</p>

<p>Frank was glad to offer this hospitality to his
new chance acquaintance. The man interested
him. Everything he talked about he covered in a
vivid way that made his descriptions instructive.
Already he had suggested some points to Frank
that had set the latter thinking in new directions.
The wide experience of the man was suggestive
and valuable to Frank.</p>

<p>Park Gregson asked the telegraph operator to
send any reply to his message to the Newton home,
and accompanied Frank there.</p>

<p>As they neared the cottage a man in a gig came
driving down the road. It was Dorsett.</p>

<p>He glared fiercely at Frank, and then bestowed
an inquisitive, suspicious look upon the stranger.</p>

<p>Frank introduced Gregson to his mother, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
prepared a lunch for him. Gregson was more
shaken up than he had expressed, and was glad to
lie down and rest in the neatly-furnished spare
room of the cottage.</p>

<p>Frank had some odd chores to do about the village.
When he came home again about six o’clock
he found Gregson refreshed-looking and comfortably
seated in the parlor reading a book.</p>

<p>They had a pleasant time at the supper table.
Then they adjourned to the cozy little sitting-room.
Christmas was allowed to stay in the house, and
seemed to enjoy the animated ways of the balloonist
as much as the others.</p>

<p>Park Gregson fairly fascinated them with the
story of his travels and adventures in many countries.</p>

<p>“You see, I have been quite a rolling stone, Mrs.
Ismond,” he said. “A harmless one, though.”</p>

<p>“Have you never thought of settling down to
some regular occupation, sir?” suggested Frank’s
mother.</p>

<p>“It’s not in me, madam, I fear,” declared the
knockaround. “I did try it once, for a fact. Yes,
I actually went into business.”</p>

<p>“What was the line, Mr. Gregson?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“Mail order business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank showed by the expression of his face that
the balloonist had struck a theme of great interest
to him.</p>

<p>“I had a partner,” went on Gregson. “We advertised
and sold sets of rubber finger tips to protect
the hands of housewives when working about
the house.”</p>

<p>“Was it a success?” inquired Frank.</p>

<p>“It was great&mdash;famous. The orders just
rolled in. We made money hand over fist and
spent it like water. One day, though, there came
a stop to it all. A lawyer served an injunction on
us. It seemed that the device was a French invention
patented in this country. My partner sloped
with most of the funds, leaving me stranded. All
the same, it’s a great business&mdash;the mail order
line.”</p>

<p>For over an hour Frank kept their guest busy answering
a hundred earnest questions as to all the
details of the mail order business.</p>

<p>When Gregson had retired for the night Frank
sat silent and thoughtful in the company of his
mother. Finally he said.</p>

<p>“Mother, Mr. Gregson’s talk has done me a lot
of good.”</p>

<p>“I saw you were very much interested,” remarked
Mrs. Ismond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Interested!” repeated Frank with vim, unable
to control his restless spirit and getting up and pacing
the room to and fro&mdash;“I am simply wild to
go deeper into this mail order business. Why, it
looks plain as day to me&mdash;the way to begin it&mdash;the
way to exploit it&mdash;the way to make a great
big success of it. He says that little metal novelties
of the household kind take the best. I was
just thinking: there’s a hardware novelties factory
right on the spot at Pleasantville, and&mdash;Down,
Christmas, down!”</p>

<p>The dog had interrupted Frank with a low
growl. Then, before Frank could deter him, the
animal flew at the open window of the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Frank seized Christmas by the collar, just as the
animal was aiming to leap clear through it to the
garden outside.</p>

<p>“Why, what is the matter, Christmas?” spoke
Mrs. Ismond, arising to her feet in some surprise.</p>

<p>Just then a frightful shriek rang out from under
the open window, accompanied by the frantic
words:</p>

<p>“Help, murder, help&mdash;I’m nearly killed!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>“MAIL ORDER FRANK”</small></h2>


<p>At the outcry from beyond the window of the
little sitting-room, the dog, Christmas, became
fairly frantic. Seizing him by the collar, however,
Frank gave him a stern word. Wont to obey, the
animal retreated to one side of the room, but still
growling, and his fur bristling.</p>

<p>Frank instantly caught up the lamp from the table
and carried it to the window. His mother
peered out in a startled way at the scene now illuminated
without.</p>

<p>“Why, it is Mr. Dorsett!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“As I expected,” said Frank, quietly.</p>

<p>“Frank,” murmured his mother, anxiously,
“what have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“Preparing for eavesdroppers&mdash;and sneaks.
Caught one first set of the trap, it seems,” responded
Frank in clear, loud tones.</p>

<p>The captured lurker was indeed Dorsett. He
was panting and infuriated. One foot was held
imprisoned in a wooden spring clamp chained to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
log in a hole in the ground. This aperture had
been covered with light pieces of sod which Dorsett
was pushing aside with his cane, while he continued
to groan with pain.</p>

<p>The lamplight enabled him to discern more
clearly the trap that had caught him. He managed
to pull one side of the contrivance loose and
got his foot free.</p>

<p>Wincing with pain and limping, he came closer
to the window, boiling with rage.</p>

<p>“So you did it, and boast of it, do you?” he
howled at Frank.</p>

<p>“I did and do,” answered Frank calmly.
“This is our home, Mr. Dorsett, not a public
highway.”</p>

<p>Dorsett uttered a terrific snort of rage. He
brandished his cane, struck out with it, and its end
went through the panes of both the upper and the
raised lower sash.</p>

<p>Frank receded a step, unhurt, with the words:</p>

<p>“Very well. You will pay for that damage, I
suppose you know. You will get no further rent
until you repair it.”</p>

<p>“Rent!” roared the frenzied Dorsett. “You’ll
never pay me rent again. I’ll show you. Tenants
at will, ha! Can’t stroll around my own property,
hey? Why, I’ll&mdash;I’ll crush you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Dorsett,” spoke up the widow in a dignified
tone, “it is true this is your property, but you
have no right to spy upon us. You took away our
dog&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who says so&mdash;who says so?” shouted the infuriated
man.</p>

<p>“Christmas himself will say so in an unmistakable
manner if I let him loose at you,” answered
Frank. “The poundmaster at Riverton might be
a credible witness, also.”</p>

<p>“You’ll pay for this, oh, but you’ll pay for
this!” snarled the wretched old man as he limped
away to the street.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ismond sank to a chair, quite pale and
agitated over the disturbing incident of the moment.</p>

<p>“Frank,” she said in a fluttering tone, “that
man alarms me. It makes me uneasy to think he
is lurking about us all the time. I am unhappy to
think we are subject to his caprices, where once
he owned the property.”</p>

<p>“We own it yet, by rights,” declared Frank.
“Some day I may prove it to Dorsett. But do
not worry, mother. You must have guessed from
my interest in what Mr. Gregson said to-night,
that I believe there is something for me in this mail
order idea. I have not yet formed my plans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
but I am going to get into business for myself.”</p>

<p>The boy heard their guest stirring about up
stairs, probably aroused by the window smashing.
He reassured Gregson and went to bed himself.</p>

<p>Frank lay awake until nearly midnight thinking
over all that Gregson had told him. He went
mentally through every phase of the mail order
idea that he knew anything about.</p>

<p>When Frank finally fell asleep it was to dream
of starting in business for himself. At broad daylight
he was in a big factory which his own endeavors
had built up. Around him were his busy employes
nailing up great boxes of merchandise
ordered from all parts of the country.</p>

<p>The sound of the hammers seemed still echoing
in his ears as he was aroused by the voice of his
mother from her own room.</p>

<p>“Frank! Frank!” she called.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother,” he answered, springing out of
bed.</p>

<p>“Some one is knocking at the front door.”</p>

<p>“Knocking?” repeated Frank, hurrying into his
clothes. “That’s no knocking, it sounds more
like hammering.”</p>

<p>Christmas was barking furiously. The hammering
had ceased by the time Frank had got down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the stairs and to the front door. He unlocked it
quickly.</p>

<p>At the end of the graveled walk, just turning
into the street was old Dorsett. He waved a hammer
in his hand malignantly as he noticed Frank.</p>

<p>“We’ll see if I am to have free range of my
own premises,” he shouted. “Young man, you
get your traps out of here within the time limit of
the law, or I’ll throw you into the street, bag and
baggage.”</p>

<p>Frank saw that Dorsett had just nailed a square
white sheet of paper across the door panel. He
stood reading it over as his mother came out onto
the porch.</p>

<p>“Was that Mr. Dorsett, Frank?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, some more of his friendly work.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Frank?”</p>

<p>“A five-days’ notice to quit,” answered Frank.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ismond scanned the legal document with a
pale and troubled face. Frank affected unconcern
and indifference.</p>

<p>“Don’t let that worry you, mother,” he said,
leading her back into the house.</p>

<p>“But, Frank, he can put us out!”</p>

<p>“If we stay to let him, probably. The law he
has invoked to rob us, may also enable him to evict
us, mother, but he won’t win in the end. You say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
you dislike the place. Very well, we will move.”</p>

<p>“But where to, Frank?”</p>

<p>“This isn’t the only house in Greenville, is it,
mother?” asked Frank, smiling reassuringly.
“What’s more, Greenville isn’t the only town in
creation. Stop your fretting, now. I’ve got a
grand plan, and I am sure to carry it out. Just
leave everything to me. My head is just bursting
with all the ideas that interesting balloonist has put
into it. Why, mother, if I can only get a start, if
I can get hold of a few novelties and do a little
advertising&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Frank, it takes money to do all that!”</p>

<p>“And brains. Mostly brains and industry, Mr.
Gregson says. Mother, now or soon, here, at
Greenville or somewhere else, I am determined to
give the mail order idea a trial.”</p>

<p>“Mail order, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Capital! excellent!” cried Frank with enthusiasm.
“Why, mother, you have suggested the
very catchy name. I will use to advertise by&mdash;‘Mail
Order Frank’!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>STRICTLY BUSINESS</small></h2>


<p>The balloonist, Park Gregson, needed rest
after his strenuous experience of the previous day,
so Frank did not disturb him. He and his mother
had their breakfast together, then Frank started
out on his usual daily round of duties.</p>

<p>He did his chores about the house. Then he
went down to the eight o’clock train to get a bundle
of daily newspapers from the city. These he
delivered to his regular customers. At nine
o’clock he went to the office of Mr. Beach, the
lawyer.</p>

<p>Frank was informed by the attorney’s clerk that
Mr. Beach had left Greenville to see a distant
client. He would not be back for two days.</p>

<p>“I need somebody’s advice about this five-day
notice of Mr. Dorsett,” reflected Frank, and proceeded
to visit the insurance man, Mr. Buckner.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the latter briskly, as
Frank put in an appearance, “I was just about to
send for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“To send for me?” repeated Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, I told you that you might expect some
further business commissions from me, you remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Buckner.”</p>

<p>“Well, they have materialized. Can you give
me your time unrestrictedly for a week or ten
days?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;yes, I think so,” answered Frank, but
somewhat slowly, for he thought of their family
complications.</p>

<p>Mr. Buckner was a keen-witted man. He read
something under the surface in Frank’s hesitancy.</p>

<p>“Something troubling you, Frank?” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing serious, Mr. Buckner. It seems
we have offended Mr. Dorsett. He is our landlord.
He has ordered us to leave the house we
rent from him within five days.”</p>

<p>“Hum, the old curmudgeon! His house! I
wonder whose it would be if some of his clever rascality
was investigated?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we have got to go,” said
Frank. “He is ugly and determined.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that difficulty can be easily solved,” declared
Mr. Buckner, lightly. “You know the vacant
store front on Cedar street? I am agent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that property, owner a non-resident. There are
five nice, comfortable living rooms upstairs. It’s
only two blocks’ move for you. If it suits you,
make the move. You need pay no rent until you
decide where you wish to locate permanently.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;never thought of it!” exclaimed Mr.
Buckner, with new animation of manner and voice.
“The very thing, it exactly fits!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” inquired Frank.</p>

<p>“Sit down, and I’ll explain. You took a check
yesterday to pay for some salvage at a fire at
Riverton.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” nodded Frank.</p>

<p>“I notified my client last night by telegraph of
our success. He’s a Lancaster man, in the hardware
line. He ran up to Greenville last evening
to see me. It seems that Morton, the man burned
out at Riverton, was also in the hardware line.
Everything he had was burned up in the fire.
When they came to clear the wreck, they found all
the metal stock he carried massed in among the
ashes in the cellar. The insurance company had
it put in big packing cases. It was all mixed up,
some of the stock damaged entirely. My client,
however, decided that it might net him a profit on
the two hundred dollars he paid for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“What he has engaged me to do, is to go or
send to Riverton and get the stuff carted over here.
Then he wants the rubbish gone over, and the
good stuff selected and sorted out. It seems that
Morton had been neglecting his regular hardware
business for some time. He invented an apple
corer that wouldn’t core very well. He bought a
lot of little stuff, such as initial buttons, needles
and the like, and was trying to get into the mail
order business, when the fire came along.”</p>

<p>“The mail order business?” said Frank in a
quick breath.</p>

<p>“Yes. Now he’s going to take his insurance
money and buy an interest in some publishing business
in the city. Well, you can see that a little
time and care may result in picking out quite a lot
of really valuable stuff from the mass, brushing it
up and all that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” murmured Frank.</p>

<p>“We can store the plunder in the Cedar Street
building. You take charge of it, hire what help
you need, and I’ll divide with you what I charge
my client for my services. Pretty liberal, ain’t I
now, Frank?” asked Mr. Buckner, with a smile.
“You doing all the work, and me getting a full
half of the pay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, but you are the directing genius of the affair,
you know,” suggested Frank pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can direct all right, if you will do the
hustling,” laughed the insurance man. “Settled,
is it? All right. My client thinks it will take a
week or ten days to sort the stuff into some kind of
shape. He’ll be here to inspect progress next Saturday.
You make your arrangements, and draw
five dollars a day.”</p>

<p>Frank was quite stunned at the munificent offer.</p>

<p>“I trust you implicitly, Frank,” went on his
kind friend. “Here is a letter to the custodian of
the property at Riverton, and here is twenty dollars
to carry around with you to meet any expense
that may come up. Hire the moving teams as
cheaply as you can, store the boxes at the Cedar
Street place. I leave the details entirely to you.
When can you start in?”</p>

<p>“Right now,” replied Frank promptly.</p>

<p>“All right, get into action.”</p>

<p>Frank was proud and pleased as he hurried back
home. He did not let the grass grow under his
feet, but neither did he go off in a wild tangent
that might disorder things. He was all business
and system.</p>

<p>First, he reported to his mother. They decided
to move at once. Then he sought out Nelson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Cady, a close chum, and commissioned him to
look after his evening paper route and other odd
jobs he did daily. Frank decided he could save
money by hiring home talent to do the moving of
the salvage stuff. He was not much acquainted at
Riverton. The teamsters there might be extortionate,
as it was a double trip for the wagons.</p>

<p>Within an hour’s time Frank had made an excellent
bargain, and all interested were duly satisfied
with the arrangement. An honest old negro
named Eben Johnson, who carted ashes and other
refuse for the town, was not doing much that especial
day. He agreed to lease his two teams and
one driver for twelve hours for seven dollars and
the keep of man and horses.</p>

<p>Frank knew he could make no more economical
arrangement than this. By eleven o’clock he was
on the way to Riverton, acting himself as driver of
one of the teams.</p>

<p>The driver of the other team was a good-natured
though rather shiftless fellow, named Boyle.
When they reached Riverton, Frank took him to a
restaurant, gave him the best meal he had ever
eaten, and made the fellow his friend for life.
The horses were given a first class feed and a
good rest.</p>

<p>Frank found he had to handle eight immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
packing cases and one zinc box. This latter was
full of books and papers. These went to the purchaser,
it seemed, along with the “good will” of
the business.</p>

<p>The eight packing cases were tremendously
heavy. A glance at their contents showed Frank
a confused jumble. There were hammers and
hatchets with their handles burned off, saws and
chisels, blackened, and some of them burned out
of shape by the fire. There were nails, tacks,
hinges, keys, door knobs, in fact a confusing mass
of mixed hardware of every description.</p>

<p>Frank and his man could not handle four of the
cases alone. The lad had to hire a couple of
men to help them load these onto the wagons. As
they got all ready to start for home, the custodian
came up with a little wizened man with a Jewish
cast of countenance, and introduced him as Mr.
Moss.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of junk not worth carting away
over at the ruins,” explained the custodian to
Frank. “This man wants to buy it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Frank, “let him make an
offer.”</p>

<p>“Mein frient, two dollars would be highway
robbery for dot oldt stuff,” asserted the junk
dealer, with a characteristic shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is that your offer, Mr. Moss?” asked Frank
in a business-like tone.</p>

<p>“I vill gif it chust to spite oldt Isaacs, my combetitor,”
declared Moss.</p>

<p>“Well, we will go and take a look at the stuff,”
said Frank.</p>

<p>“Mein frient, dot vos useless,” insisted Moss.
“Time ish monish. Tree tollars!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Frank definitely. “I always calculate
to know what I’m about.”</p>

<p>He left the wagons, and accompanied by Moss
soon reached the blackened ruins of the hardware
store.</p>

<p>Just as they arrived there, a shrewd-faced little
urchin approaching them halted, and gave both a
keen look.</p>

<p>“Hoo!” he yelled&mdash;“I must tell vader!”</p>

<p>Moss threw his cane after the disappearing
urchin, and looked perturbed and anxious.</p>

<p>“Dot vos de stuff,” he explained, pointing out
two cindery piles back of the ruins.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Frank, poking in and out among
the debris, “there is quite a heap of it.”</p>

<p>“Ashes, mein frient, ashes,” suavely observed
the junk dealer.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” retorted Frank. “Here is a
stove, all but the top. Here are a lot of hoes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
rakes, twisted a little, but not entirely worthless.
Both heaps are nearly all solid metal. There must
be over a ton of iron here.”</p>

<p>“Four tollars&mdash;I tell you vot I do: four tollars,”
said Moss fervently.</p>

<p>Frank shook his head and continued to look
calculatingly at the blackened heaps.</p>

<p>“Five tollars,” spoke Moss with sudden unction.
“Mein tear younug frient&mdash;cash. Say nodings.
Dere vos de monish.”</p>

<p>But Frank looked resolutely away from the bank
note tendered as a near shout rang out.</p>

<p>A stout, clumsy man had come lumbering
around the corner at his best gait, in a frantic state
of excitement.</p>

<p>He was in his shirt sleeves, drenched with perspiration
and waving his arms wildly. Beside him
ran the urchin Frank had before noticed. It was
apparent that he had succeeded in satisfying his
father that a sale of the fire debris was on.</p>

<p>“Mishter, Mishter,” he called, “it is Ezekiels
Isaacs. I vill puy de goods. How mooch is offered?”</p>

<p>“Five dollars so far,” repeated Frank tranquilly.</p>

<p>“Six,” instantly bolted out the newcomer.</p>

<p>“Seven!” snarled Moss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ten tollars,” pronounced the other, pulling
out a fat pocketbook.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Frank. “I have made up
my mind. You must start your real bids at double
that, or I cannot entertain an offer.”</p>

<p>“Yesh,” cried Moss eagerly&mdash;“twenty tollars.”</p>

<p>“Und a kee-varter!” howled his rival.</p>

<p>“Un a hal-luf!”</p>

<p>“Tage it!” roared Moss, waving his cane in
impotent rage, and turned away disgusted.</p>

<p>“Of course you gif me four per cent. discount
for cash?” demanded the successful bidder.</p>

<p>“Of course I shall not,” dissented Frank.
“Shall I call back Mr. Moss? No? Thanks,&mdash;that
is correct, twenty dollars and fifty cents.
Here is a receipt.”</p>

<p>Frank felt that he had closed an exceptionally
good sale. Within half-an-hour the wagons were
started on their way for Greenville.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>A STEP FORWARD</small></h2>


<p>The return trip took three hours. It was just
five o’clock when the wagons drew up in front of
the store front building on Cedar Street, in Greenville.</p>

<p>A man whom Mr. Buckner had hired was
sweeping out the place. With his aid and that of
another helper, the big packing cases were stowed
in the main floor room as Frank wanted them.</p>

<p>Frank had just paid off the two outsiders, when
the man he had leased the wagons from drove up
in a light vehicle. He was all smiles. He looked
over the horses and turned to Frank.</p>

<p>“Mistah Newton, sah,” he observed, “the
mussiful man am kind to his beast. Ah see dem
hosses in good trim, sah, and am obleeged. Sah,
you am a good-luck boy. Like to hire you as my
manager, sah, ef I had enough money. Ha!
Ha!”</p>

<p>“Where does the good luck come in, Mr. Johnson?”
inquired Frank smilingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah tell you ’bout dat, sah. Logic am logic.
Theyfoh, it follows ef I’d gone up to dat no-good,
cheap hauling for de lumbah comp’ny I’d been out
five dollahs, ’cause you paid me seben, ’sides having
de hosses worked to death. Again, sah, de
suckamstance am dis: I happened to be in town
when a stranger gen’man came ’long and hiahed
me to drive him into de woods. Got another gen’man
from your house. I helped dem get a b’loon
down from a tree, load it on de wagon and took
it to de train. One ob de gen’mans knew you ’ticularly,
sah.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Gregson,” murmured Frank.
“Did both leave town?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah, with the b’loon.”</p>

<p>Frank was sorry he had not seen his entertaining
acquaintance before he went away. Mr. Johnson
continued:</p>

<p>“Rar gen’man, dose, ’specially dat professor.
What think, sah? He say: ‘How much am dis
exertion on youah part worth, Mistah Johnsing?’
and when I say, ‘Bout eight bits, Mistah Professor,’
he laugh and gib me a five dollah gold piece.
And de other gen’man say to me confimadentially:
‘Mistah Johnsing, please tell young Mistah Newton
I shall write to him, and when I get making a
little money I shall do myself de pleashah of sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
him a gold watch and chain, and dat dog of his
a gold collah.’ Deed he did, sah.”</p>

<p>Frank laughed pleasantly, believing that “Mistah
Johnsing” was romancing a trifle. Then he
said: “I believe our contract on the teams was
for twelve hours’ service, Mr. Johnson?”</p>

<p>“Dat am correct, sah.”</p>

<p>“If you say so, I will give them a good feed
and do our moving from the house to the rooms
upstairs here. Of course I will pay your man for
the extra labor.”</p>

<p>“Dat am highly satisfact’ry to me, Mistah
Newton.”</p>

<p>The two teams were driven over to the cottage
and unhitched in front of it. Frank rigged up a
convenient feed trough, gave the horses their oats,
and invited Boyle to join him at supper.</p>

<p>Frank had talked over the moving question with
his mother that morning. He found that she had
put in a busy day. All the pictures were removed
from the walls and neatly encased in newspapers.
The books had been placed in boxes; everything,
even to the beds, carried from upstairs.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, Mrs. Ismond spread
out an appetizing meal for the two workers.</p>

<p>“Mother, this really won’t do,” remonstrated
Frank seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“What won’t do, my son?” asked his mother,
smiling.</p>

<p>“Carrying those heavy things down stairs.”</p>

<p>“But I did not do that&mdash;at least not all of
it,” the widow hastened to say. “Your friend,
Nelson Cady, happened along about three o’clock.
Nothing would do but he must lend a helping
hand. Then his chums found him out. They
were soon in service, too.”</p>

<p>Just as Frank finished his supper there were
cheery boyish hails outside. Nelson and five of
his cohorts animatedly demanded that they become
part and parcel in the fun and excitement of moving.</p>

<p>Soon there was a procession carrying various
articles to the rooms on Cedar Street. The
wagons took the heavy furniture and such like.
Just at dark the last had left the cottage. Looking
back, Frank saw Mr. Dorsett sneaking into his
empty house from the rear.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look particularly happy, now he
has had his own way,” reflected Frank. “I hope
mother doesn’t take the change to heart.”</p>

<p>His first question was along that very line, as
the last chair was set in place in the new family
habitation.</p>

<p>“Sad, Frank?” said his mother&mdash;“no, indeed!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
When we were forced from the old home on the
hill a year ago, I was very sorrowful. It is a positive
relief now, though, to get out of the shadow
of Mr. Dorsett and all belonging to him. It is
nice, and home-like and cozy here, and I am sure
we shall be very comfortable and happy in our new
home.”</p>

<p>Many hands had aided in bestowing the family
goods just where Mrs. Ismond wanted them.
There was very little tidying up to do half-an-hour
after Frank had dismissed the teamster, with a dollar
for his extra work.</p>

<p>Then he led a gay procession down the principal
village street. They entered a little ice cream
parlor, and Frank “treated”&mdash;one ice cream and
a glass of soda water all around.</p>

<p>“I want to see you, Nelson, as early in the morning
as I can,” said Frank, as they separated for the
night.</p>

<p>“Business?” inquired Nelson, in a serious way.</p>

<p>“Why, yes. Truth is, I can put some loose
change in your pocket, if you care to undertake a
ten-days’ job I have in hand.”</p>

<p>Nelson shook his head dubiously, with a very
important air.</p>

<p>“Dunno,” he said calculatingly. “You see, I
am expecting a letter any day now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank smiled to himself. Nelson had been
“expecting a letter” every day for a year. Every
boy in the village knew this, and occasionally guyed
and jollied him about it.</p>

<p>Nelson’s great ambition was to become a cowboy.
On one occasion he had run away from
home, bound for far-away Idaho. He got as far
as the city, was nearly starved and half-frozen, and
came home meekly the next day.</p>

<p>His father gave him a good, sensible talk. He
tried to convince Nelson that he was too young to
undertake the rough life of a cowboy. This failing,
he agreed that if Nelson would get some respectable
stockman in Idaho to ensure him a regular
berth for a year, he would let him go west and
pay his fare there.</p>

<p>Since then Nelson had spent nearly all the pocket
money he could earn writing to people in Idaho,
from the Governor down. Nobody seemed to
want an inexperienced, home-bred boy to round
their stock, however. Still, Nelson kept on hoping
and trying.</p>

<p>“I’ll risk your letter coming before your contract
with me is finished, Nelson,” said Frank
kindly. “About this cowboy business, though&mdash;take
my advice and that of your good, kind father:
don’t waste your best young years just for the sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of novelty and adventure. No ambitious boy can
afford it.”</p>

<p>“But I have a longing for the wild ranch life,”
said Nelson earnestly.</p>

<p>“All right, then do your duty to those at home,
earn a good start here, where you have friends to
help you, and begin with a ranch of your own.
When I have made enough money, I would like
to run a ranch myself. But I want to own it. I
want to make a business investment&mdash;not fun and
frolic&mdash;out of it.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll be on hand in the morning,”
promised Nelson.</p>

<p>“I have been saving a surprise for you, Frank,”
said his mother, as he rejoined her about nine
o’clock. “What do you think? Your friend,
Mr. Gregson, insisted on leaving you twenty-five
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that won’t do at all!” cried Frank instantly.</p>

<p>“The professor, who was with him, insisted
that it must. Besides, they left all sorts of kind
regards for you.”</p>

<p>Frank’s was a truly grateful heart. It had been
a splendid day for him. He took up a lamp and
went downstairs, whistling happily.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of work to do here,” he said, going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
from box to box, flashing the light across the
contents. “There must be a million needles in
that packing case. Poor Morton’s apple corer&mdash;there’s
several thousands of those. And here’s a
great jumble of lawn mower repair material.”</p>

<p>Frank stood mapping out how he would handle
the mass of stuff. About to leave the room, he
set down the lamp and curiously inspected the zinc
box that had apparently been the burned-out hardware
man’s safe.</p>

<p>It was filled with papers of various kinds: receipted
bills, statements of accounts and letters.
Many of these latter were from mail customers
who had bought the apple corer and were dissatisfied
with its operation.</p>

<p>Many of the papers were partly burned away.
All were grimed with smoke. Finally from the
very bottom of the box Frank fished up a square
package. Opening this, he found it to be some
part of a mail order office equipment.</p>

<p>Frank’s eye sparkled. There were several sheets
of cardboard. On each of them a colored map of
a State of the Union was printed. Each town had
a hole near it. This was to hold minute wooden
pegs of different hues, each color designating
“written to,” or “first customer,” or “agent,” and
the like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>At a glance Frank took in the value and utility
of this outfit. As he drew some typewritten sheets
from a big manilla envelope, he grew positively excited
at the grand discovery he had made.</p>

<p>“Fifty thousand names!” exclaimed Frank&mdash;“possible
mail order customers all over the country!
Oh, if this outfit were only mine! Can I
get it, or its duplicate? Why,” he said, in a
fervent, deep-drawn breath, “circumstances seem
absolutely pushing me into the mail order business!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>SENSE AND SYSTEM</small></h2>


<p>Frank was up and stirring before six o’clock
the next morning. He felt like a person beginning
life brand-new again.</p>

<p>When his mother appeared half-an-hour later,
she found everything tidied up, including Frank
himself, who hurried through a good, hearty breakfast
with an important business engagement in
view.</p>

<p>“You will excuse me for calling at your home
instead of the office,” said Frank to Mr. Buckner,
a little later.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Frank,” declared the insurance
man, shaking hands heartily with his early
caller. “Time is money, and of course you want
to utilize it to the best advantage. Well, what’s
the news?”</p>

<p>Frank recited the progress of the day previous.
When he came to tell of the sale of the old junk
at Riverton, his host laughed till the tears ran
down his cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll do, Frank,” he observed with enthusiasm&mdash;“decidedly,
you’ll do! You got the moving
done at just half what I expected to pay, and
collected twenty dollars and a half we never knew
a word about.”</p>

<p>“Then you want me to go on getting the burned
stuff in order, do you?” inquired Frank.</p>

<p>“Certainly&mdash;that was all understood, wasn’t
it? I’ll try and drop around to-day or to-morrow
and take a look at the plunder, just out of curiosity.
As to getting it in shape for my client’s inspection,
I leave that in your able charge exclusively.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Frank.</p>

<p>Nelson Cady was piping a cheery whistle in
front of the store when Frank got home.</p>

<p>“Got no letter yet,” he announced in his old
important way, “so I reckon I can give you a lift,
Frank.”</p>

<p>“Good for you,” commended Frank. “You
know how to work all right when you want to,
Nelson.”</p>

<p>Frank unlocked the store door with a proud
sense of proprietorship. Both entered the long,
rambling room.</p>

<p>“Now then, Nelson,” said Frank, “I offer you
ten cents an hour, and make you superintendent of
the little plant here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“What am I expected to superintend?” asked
Nelson.</p>

<p>“Did you notify any of the boys?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;I could get an army of them, if
needed.”</p>

<p>“I think about half-a-dozen will answer,” said
Frank.</p>

<p>“They’ll be here shortly all right,” responded
Nelson. “It’s vacation, and&mdash;there’s the first arrival
now.”</p>

<p>A curly-pated, eager-faced little urchin popped
in through the open doorway.</p>

<p>“Hey, Nelse, am I early enough?” he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Five cents an hour,” announced Frank, with a
welcoming smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” cried the little fellow&mdash;“five times
twenty-four is, let me see&mdash;a naught and two to
carry, a dollar and twenty cents. Whoop!”</p>

<p>“Here, here, you don’t suppose we’re going to
work all day and all night, too, do you?” said
Nelson. “Eight hours will tire you out soon
enough.”</p>

<p>“Forty cents a day, then,” cried the little fellow.
“Say, I’ll be rich!”</p>

<p>Within the next ten minutes as many as a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
other boys arrived. The news of Frank Newton
having work to be done, had spread like wildfire
among juvenile Greenville. All hands begged for
employment, but Frank could not hire all of them.
He engaged first boys whose families needed help,
and promised the others they should work as substitutes
when any of the original employes dropped
out of the ranks.</p>

<p>“Now then, friends,” said Frank, as soon as the
hiring business was disposed of, “Nelson Cady
will direct what you are to do. You had better all
of you go home first and put on the oldest duds you
can find, for this is going to be dirty work. Look
here, Nelson.”</p>

<p>Frank had got a big piece of chalk at a carpenter’s
shop on his way home from the interview
with Mr. Buckner.</p>

<p>With this he now divided the floor space of one
whole side of the store into sections about six feet
square.</p>

<p>“You see, Nelson,” he said to his superintendent,
“first you tip over one of those big packing
cases onto the floor.”</p>

<p>“All right, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Then begin picking out an article at a time.
Suppose it is a hammer comes first: write with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
chalk on the edge of a section ‘Hammers,’ and
then group all the hammers you find by themselves.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” nodded Nelson.</p>

<p>“Label all the squares plainly. Mass everything
of its class in distinct heaps. That is the
first start in your work.”</p>

<p>Frank had some of his regular village chores to
do. He was gone over an hour attending to various
duties.</p>

<p>As he came back to the store again, Frank was
spurred up by the busy hum of industry. Half-a-dozen
urchins peering enviously in at the open
front door made way for him. He gave them a
kind word and stepped inside to take a sweeping
view of his juvenile working force.</p>

<p>A great rattlety-bang was going on as the boys
pulled over the heap of debris. Hands and faces
were grimed. There were some blistered fingers,
but the boys were working like bees in a hive.</p>

<p>The chalked-off sections had begun to grow in
number. One was labelled “Needles.” Frank
stared in some wonder. There were papers of
needles whole, and others with half their original
paper coverings burned away, of loose needles,
some rusted and blackened, some still bright and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
shining; there seemed to be thousands upon thousands.</p>

<p>Then there was a lot of pieces of lawn mowers,
blades, wheels, screws, cogs and axles. Hinges of
all sizes and qualities showed up prominently.
Pocket knives, scissors and carpenter tools were
likewise greatly in evidence.</p>

<p>One pile was growing rapidly with the minutes.
This was a heap of apple corers. It was a contrivance
with a small wooden knob. A screw held
a tapering piece of thin metal, which penetrated the
centre of an apple. Then a twist was supposed to
cut out the core.</p>

<p>From letters in the zinc box which Frank had
read, he knew that purchasers of this device had
complained about it greatly. In the first place it
was arbitrarily set for one uniform cut. No matter
whether the apple to be operated on was large
or small, the hole made was exactly the same. If
the fruit was hard and crisp, according to the letters
of complaint the corer split the apple. If it
was soft, the corer mushed the apple. There were
already sorted out several hundreds of these corers.
Frank wished he could get hold of them and
improve them.</p>

<p>Frank looked over all the selected stuff in view.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Then he went in turn to the village blacksmith, the
local hardware store and to a druggist friend.
He returned with some sponges, soft rags, sandpaper
and a can of oil. He chalked off new spaces
at the rear end of the store, three being devoted to
each article labelled. Then he ordered his helpers
to grade the various utensils dug out of the debris.
Thus, hammers: those burned beyond practical use
were put in heap one, second best, heap two; those
that were only slightly marred were placed in heap
three.</p>

<p>When Mr. Buckner came to the store the following
day at noon the work had progressed famously.
The insurance man was greatly gratified at the layout.</p>

<p>“Sense and system,” he said, and told Frank he
was proud of him.</p>

<p>Certainly Frank had proceeded on a routine that
was bound to bring good results. What he called
the finished product was now strongly in evidence.
He had divided his working force. Five of the
small boys helped him in getting all the salable
stuff sorted by itself.</p>

<p>Mr. Buckner’s client did not put in an appearance
until the following Tuesday. By that time
the place looked more like a real hardware store
than a repairing shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>All the best stuff was classified and neatly laid
out. The hardware man from Lancaster made
one sweeping inspection of the various piles of
merchandise. There was quite a delighted expression
on his face as he turned to Frank.</p>

<p>“Young man,” he said, “Mr. Buckner prepared
me to meet a brisk, enterprising fellow of
about your size, but the way you have handled
this business is a marvel.”</p>

<p>Frank flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Right at the start,” continued his visitor, “I
offer you a good, permanent position in my store
at Lancaster at eight dollars a week.”</p>

<p>“I thank you greatly,” replied Frank, “but I
have partly decided on some other plans with my
mother.”</p>

<p>“All right. If you change your mind, come to
me. Now then, to size up this proposition in detail.”</p>

<p>The speaker looked into and over everything.
When he had gone one round he picked up an
empty red cardboard box and began to cut it up
into small squares.</p>

<p>“I seem to have made a fine investment, Buckner,”
he said to the insurance man. “There’s
over two hundred dollars in those lawn mower
parts alone. The regular stuff like tools and cutlery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
are good for as much more. See here, Newton:
I am going to put one of these red cardboard
squares on all the lots I wish you to ship to
me at Lancaster.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” nodded Frank.</p>

<p>“Get some strong boxes and pack the stuff well,
send by freight.”</p>

<p>The hardware merchant now went from pile to
pile, placing the red bits of cardboard on about
two-thirds of the stuff.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to take those needles?” inquired
Buckner, noticing that his client had passed
them by. “Why, there’s fully a million of them.”</p>

<p>“No use for them.”</p>

<p>“And this big pile of apple corers?”</p>

<p>The hardware man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“No,” he said plumply. “They busted Morton.
If he couldn’t make them go, I can’t.”</p>

<p>“And those other heaps of second-best stuff?”
inquired Frank. “I should think they would sell
for something.”</p>

<p>“And spoil the sale of good-profit goods. No,
no. That’s poor business policy. I shall make
double good as it is. Just dump the balance into
some junk shop. Whatever you get for it you
can keep, Newton.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” interrupted Frank quickly, “you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
hardly estimate the real value there. Why, anyone
taking the trouble to put those needles up into
packages could clean up a good many dollars.
There’s a lot of sewing machine needles there, too.
They are worth three for five cents anywhere.”</p>

<p>“All right,” retorted his employer with an expansive
smile. “You do it, Newton, I won’t.
Take the stuff with my compliments, and thank you
in the bargain for all the pains you have gone to in
turning me out a first-class job.”</p>

<p>“Takes your breath away, does it, Frank?”
said Buckner, with a friendly nudge. “It will
give you some interesting dabbling to do for quite
a time to come, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” murmured Frank, his eyes shining
bright with pleasure. He was fairly overcome
at the unexpected donation. He seized the hardware
man’s hand and shook it fervently. “Sir,”
he said gratefully, “I feel that you have given me
my start in life.”</p>

<p>“Have I?” laughed his employer lightly.
“Glad. Well, the matter’s settled,” he continued,
consulting his watch&mdash;“I must catch my
train.”</p>

<p>“One little matter, please,” said Frank, advancing
to the zinc box and throwing back its cover.</p>

<p>He rapidly described what it contained, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the lists of names and the mail order routing
cards.</p>

<p>The hardware man listened in a bored, impatient
way.</p>

<p>“Don’t want any of the truck,” he said.
“Burn it up, do what you want with it. Get that
freight on to me quick as you can, Newton. Buckner
here will settle your bill for services. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Frank Newton stood like one in a dream after
his visitors had departed.</p>

<p>A great wave of hope, ambition, the grandest
anticipations filled his mind.</p>

<p>“Mine!” he said, passing slowly from heap to
heap consigned to him as a free gift. “Mine,”
he repeated, his hand resting on the zinc box.
“At least fifty dollars in cash out of the work I
have done, and the basis of a regular business in
what that man has given me. Oh, what a royal
start!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>A VISIT TO THE CITY</small></h2>


<p>“It almost frightens me!” said Frank Newton’s
mother.</p>

<p>The speaker looked quite serious, as she sat facing
her son, who had just read over to her the contents
of several closely-written sheets of paper.</p>

<p>“It needn’t, mother,” answered Frank with a
bright, reassuring smile. “Mr. Buckner gave me
my motto when I started in at this work. It was
‘Sense and System.’ They seem to win.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Frank, and I am very proud and happy
to see you so much in earnest, and so successful.”</p>

<p>“I have over one hundred dollars in hand,” proceeded
Frank. “We shall get fully as much more
from the sale of our assorted needle packages and
the general junk stuff down stairs. Mother, I call
that pretty fine luck for three weeks’ work.”</p>

<p>“You have certainly been very fortunate,” murmured
Mrs. Ismond.</p>

<p>“Then if it is a streak of fortune solely,” said
Frank, “I propose to make it the basis of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
bigger experiment. Yes, mother, I have fully decided
I shall get into the mail order business right
away. The first step in that direction is to see
Mr. Morton, the Riverton hardware merchant who
was burned out. He has gone into some book concern
in the city. I shall go there on the night
train, see him, and then I will know definitely
where I stand.”</p>

<p>“Is it necessary to see him?” asked Frank’s
mother. “Mr. Buckner says that everything he
left at the fire was sold as salvage. The Lancaster
man made you a present of that old zinc box. I
don’t see, having abandoned it, how Mr. Morton
has any further claim on it.”</p>

<p>“That is because you have not thought over the
matter as much as I have,” observed Frank.
“Perhaps Mr. Morton doesn’t know that the
papers in the zinc box were nearly all saved. No,
mother, I intend to start my business career on
clean, clear lines. I feel it my duty to apprise Mr.
Morton of the true condition of things. If I lose
by it, all right. I have acted according to the
dictates of my conscience.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ismond glanced fondly and fervently at
Frank. Her approbation of his sentiments
showed in her glistening eyes.</p>

<p>A week had passed by since the Lancaster man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
had settled up with Frank. It had been a busy,
bustling week for the embryo young mail order
merchant and his assistants.</p>

<p>Frank had got his employees to sort out the
myriad of needles into lots of twenty-four. He
bought some little pay envelopes, and had printed
on these: “Frank’s Mail Order House. Two
Dozen Assorted Needles.”</p>

<p>As said before, this was vacation time. There
was scarcely a boy in Greenville who did not take
a turn at selling the needle packages, which Frank
wholesaled at six cents each.</p>

<p>Most of the boys sold a few packages at home
and to immediate neighbors, and then quit work.
Others, however, made a regular business of it.
Nelson Cady took in two partners, borrowed a
light gig, and to date had met with signal success
in covering other towns in the county.</p>

<p>“Why,” he had declared enthusiastically to
Frank only that evening, when he handed over the
cash for two hundred new packages of the needles,
which Mrs. Ismond was kept busy putting up, “if
the needles hold out, I could extend and extend
my travelling trips and work my way clear to
Idaho.”</p>

<p>“You are certainly making more than expenses,”
said Frank encouragingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, but you see”&mdash;with his usual seriousness
explained Nelson, “that letter may come any day,
and I want to be on hand to get it.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” nodded Frank gravely, but he felt
that poor Nelson’s hopes were like those of the
man whose ship never came in.</p>

<p>While his young assistants were thus earning
good pocket money and Frank was accumulating
more and more capital daily, he kept up a powerful
thinking.</p>

<p>A limitless field of endeavor seemed spread out
before him. The handling of the salvage stock
had been a positive education to him.</p>

<p>“I see where the Riverton hardware man
failed,” Frank said to himself many times, “and I
think I know how I can succeed.”</p>

<p>Frank packed up the contents of the zinc box
in a satchel with a couple of clean collars, cuffs
and handkerchiefs, and consulted a railway time-table.</p>

<p>“If I take the train that goes through Greenville
at three o’clock in the morning, mother,” he
said, “I arrive at the city at exactly ten o’clock.
Just the hour for business.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, after supper you lay down and
sleep till two o’clock. I will busy myself putting
up some more of the needles,” suggested Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Ismond. “I will have a little early morning lunch
ready for you, and you can start off rested.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Frank warmly. “It’s
worth working for such a mother as you.”</p>

<p>Frank reached the deserted railway depot of
Greenville in time for the train. Nearly everybody
was dozing in the car he entered. He had a
seat to himself, and plenty of time and opportunity
for reflection.</p>

<p>Frank consulted the sheets of writing he had
read to his mother the evening previous. They
contained his business plans. He had figured out
what two hundred dollars would do towards starting
a modest mail order business. However, so
much depended on the result of his interview with
Mr. Morton in the city, that Frank awaited that
event with a good deal of anxiety.</p>

<p>When the train neared the terminus Frank took
a good wash, put on a clean collar, and tidied up
generally. Leaving the train he bought a satisfactory
meal at a restaurant, and was ready for
business.</p>

<p>Frank soon located the book concern in which
Mr. Morton had invested his money. It occupied
four gaudy offices, one of which was occupied exclusively
by Mr. Morton. Frank had to wait his
turn for an interview. While seated in the anteroom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
he learned something of the business going
on from the conversation of some callers there.</p>

<p>It appeared that the concern sold book outfits
to canvassers on a conditional salary guarantee.
From what Frank gleaned very few ever made
good, so the chief revenue of the company came
from the original outfit sale.</p>

<p>Finally Frank was called into Mr. Morton’s office.
The latter looked him over with an urbane
smile.</p>

<p>“Came in response to our advertisement for
agents, I suppose?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Frank. “It is solely on
personal business. I came to see you, sir&mdash;about
your old business at Riverton.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton shrugged his shoulders impatiently,
as though the reminder was unpleasant.</p>

<p>“Bills?” he growled out. “Thought I’d settled
everything&mdash;sick of the whole business, and
threw it up in the air for good. Go on.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Frank, “I sort of represent the
people who bought the salvage from the fire insurance
folks.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to do with that.”</p>

<p>“Among the debris there was a zinc box with
some of your papers in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I remember,” nodded Mr. Morton.
“Nearly all burned up, weren’t they?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. In looking them over I found some
of your old customers’ accounts, and that like. I
thought they might be valuable to you, so I came
down from Greenville where I live to bring them
to you.”</p>

<p>“You did?” exclaimed Mr. Morton with a
stare, partly suspicious, partly surprised. “That’s
queer.”</p>

<p>Frank said no more. He opened the suit case
and removed its two neatly put up packages. One
contained the private papers of Mr. Morton. The
other contained the mailing lists and mail order
system layout.</p>

<p>Frank placed the two parcels on the desk before
his host. The latter chanced to open the
larger package first. He carelessly ran over the
lists and the accompanying literature.</p>

<p>“H’m,” he said rather irritably, “I’ve little use
for that monument of my fool-killer experiment!”</p>

<p>Frank was relieved&mdash;in fact, pleased, to observe
Mr. Morton contemptuously sweep aside the
litter before him and inspect the second package.</p>

<p>This interested him. He sorted out quite a lot
of bills and receipts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Guess I’m a careless business man,” he spoke at
last. “That fire so discouraged me I just got
out, bag and baggage. There’s some good, collectible
bills here. Now then, young man,” he
continued, facing squarely about on Frank, “don’t
tell me you came way down here from Greenville
with that stuff just out of courtesy and kindness.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you the whole story, if you have the
time to listen to it,” replied Frank.</p>

<p>“Certainly&mdash;fire away.”</p>

<p>Frank recited his experience with the salvage
from start to finish. He wound up with the
words: “You can see, sir, very plainly that I
have hopes of getting those lists. I have a little
money, and I will be glad to buy them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton studied Frank in a pleased, interested
way.</p>

<p>“Young man,” he said, “you have acted very
honorably in coming to me the way you have. As
to that mail order literature, cart it away. I don’t
want it. I might sell the lists, if I had the time&mdash;I
haven’t&mdash;so they are yours. And, look
here, these bills&mdash;I’ll give you half of what you
collect on them.”</p>

<p>“You will?” exclaimed Frank, doubly delighted.
“I will gladly meet the trial for ten per
cent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” insisted Mr. Morton, “there’s some expense
and trouble, you not living in Riverton.
You’ll have to hire a rig to visit some of my former
debtors. I’ve stated the proposition. Here, I’ll
write you out an authority to act as my agent.”</p>

<p>Frank arose to leave the office half-an-hour later
a satisfied and grateful boy. Mr. Morton had
quizzed him considerably as to his future plans.
He was down on the mail order business, for he
had made a failure of it himself, but he said a
good many enlightening things that at least warned
Frank of the pitfalls in his business course.</p>

<p>“Please, one more word, Mr. Morton,” said
Frank, taking up his repacked suit case&mdash;“about
those apple corers of yours?”</p>

<p>“Whew!” cried his host with a wry grimace,
“have I got to think of that grand flare-up
again?”</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of them, you know, among the
salvage?” suggested Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there would have been a lot more if
the fire hadn’t stopped returns,” declared Mr. Morton.
“That was a bad investment.”</p>

<p>“Did you patent the apple corer Mr. Morton?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes&mdash;my attorney filed the caveat, I
believe. I don’t think we ever completed the patent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
transaction, and of course I shan’t throw away
any more good money on it.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking,” said Frank, “that with a
little modification&mdash;improvement, you know?
maybe it might be made to work satisfactorily.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton made such an excited jump straight
towards his young visitor that Frank was rather
startled.</p>

<p>“Young man,” he said, very solemnly, “if you
want me to lose all the really profound admiration
I feel towards you for the business-like way in
which you have managed things, don’t, for mercy’s
sake, tell me that you have been bitten, too, with
the fatal, crazy, irrational dream that you want to
invent something!”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Frank, with a smile, “is it as bad
as that?”</p>

<p>“Worse!” declared Mr. Morton, with a comical
groan. “Get the patent bee in your bonnet,
and you’re lost, doomed!” in a mock-hollow tone
observed Mr. Morton, shaking Frank by the arm.
“Drop it, drop it, or you’re on the rocks.”</p>

<p>“Then,” suggested Frank, “you won’t mind if
I experiment with the corer?”</p>

<p>“Mind? I wish you’d sink it. I wish I could
forget the money I lost in it. It’s yours, though,
if you want it, only never mention that an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
dreamer of my name ever got dazzled with a toy
like that. Stick to the straight business line, lad&mdash;mail
order, if you must, but cut off the frills.
Don’t wreck your ship on gewgaws that are a delusion
and a snare.”</p>

<p>Frank left the office of the book concern in a
happy, hopeful mood. Everything had come out
beyond his fondest anticipations. He was glad he
had been truthful and honest in the broadest sense
of the word.</p>

<p>He went back to the railroad depot and left his
suit case in the check room. A return train for
Greenville left at two o’clock, but Frank wanted to
see the city. Outside of that, he wished to visit
one or two large mail order houses.</p>

<p>Frank employed six hours to grand advantage.
He came to the depot feeling that the money he
had spent was a good investment.</p>

<p>After a light lunch he sat down on a bench in
the waiting room. He counted over the little pile
of bank notes in his pocketbook with a pleased
smile.</p>

<p>“Just think,” he reflected, “I expected to pay
Mr. Morton twenty, maybe thirty dollars for those
lists and the routing outfit, and here I am going
back home with practically all my original capital.
Then, too, the collection of those bills at Riverton:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
why, it just seems as if fortune has picked me
out as a special favorite.”</p>

<p>Frank found the train he was to take would not
leave for over an hour. It was already made up
and standing on its track, but still locked up and
unlighted. Frank went outside and strolled up
and down the dark platform alongside the train.</p>

<p>He was full of pleasing, engrossing thoughts,
and did not notice a large, shrewd-eyed man who
had followed him from the waiting room.</p>

<p>Frank was just returning to promenade back
from the front end of the train, when a sharp
rustle made him turn half around.</p>

<p>Instantly a pair of brawny arms were stretched
out towards him. Both of his hands were imprisoned
in the grasp of a sprawling fist.</p>

<p>“Hey, keep quiet, or I’ll smash you,” spoke a
harsh voice. “Now then, young man, I want that
money you’ve got in your pocket.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>A FRIEND IN NEED</small></h2>


<p>“Hands off!” cried Frank.</p>

<p>His assailant laughed coarsely. He had Frank
firmly in his grasp. Pushing him against the steps
of one of the coaches, still gripping his two wrists
in one hand he bent him back flat.</p>

<p>No one was in sight down the long, poorly-illuminated
passenger platform. Frank at once
guessed that the fellow had seen him counting over
his money in the waiting room and had followed
him to this spot.</p>

<p>Frank twisted his lower limbs to one side. His
assailant was trying with his free hand to reach the
pocket in which he had seen Frank place his little
cash capital. Frank’s movement disconcerted the
would-be thief. He grew angry as his captive
wriggled onto one side, holding his pocket pinned
up against the car step.</p>

<p>“Hi, you, turn over,” growled the fellow.</p>

<p>He gave Frank a jerk and then slapped him
hard against the side of the head. He managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to thrust his hand into his pocket containing the
money.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” he yelled, just as his eager fingers
touched the roll of bank notes. “Zounds! who
did that?”</p>

<p>Whack&mdash;Frank caught this sound, preceded
by the air-cutting whistle of some swiftly-directed
object.</p>

<p>Whack&mdash;whack! the sound was repeated.
Frank was free. His assailant had relaxed his
grasp. His hands were now busy warding off
mysterious blows in the face.</p>

<p>Frank darted to one side, his precious savings
clasped by one hand. He stared in wonder.</p>

<p>Some one on the roof of the front passenger
coach was leaning over its rounding edge. He
was armed with a jointed piece of iron. This he
plied whip-fashion. Twice its end had struck the
robber’s face, leaving two great red welts.</p>

<p>Then a spry, nimble form dropped from the car
roof to the platform. Frank made out a boy
about his own age. He was dressed wretchedly,
and was thin and weak-looking, and his face was
grimed, but he must have had pluck, for, running
straight up to the would-be thief, he plied the
weapon in his grasp like a flail.</p>

<p>A sharp blow made the ruffian roar with pain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Holding a hand to his eye, he retreated down the
platform, fairly beaten off.</p>

<p>“There’s a police officer,” said Frank suddenly,
noticing a man wearing a uniform come running
down the platform from the direction of the waiting
room.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” ejaculated his rescuer, springing
nimbly to the platform of the nearest coach.</p>

<p>“Hold on, hold on,” cried Frank&mdash;“I want to
thank you, I&mdash;”</p>

<p>But his mysterious friend had sprung across the
car platform in a jiffy. He was swallowed up in
the darkness beyond.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” hailed the policeman, running
up breathlessly.</p>

<p>“A man tried to rob me,” explained Frank.</p>

<p>“Thought I made out a struggle. Did he get
anything?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Where did he go?”</p>

<p>Frank pointed towards the fan-shaped network
of tracks melting into the gloom of the switchyards.</p>

<p>The policeman ran in that direction. Frank
did not accompany him. He did not believe the
officer would catch the thief. Besides, Frank was
more interested in the strange young fellow who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
had done him such good service in his time of need.</p>

<p>Frank stepped up on the coach platform and
peered up and down the sidings near by. His rescuer
was nowhere in sight. Frank was sorry for
this. The boy had struck him as a hard-luck object.
His manifest reluctance against being seen
by the officer suggested something sinister about
him.</p>

<p>Frank stood waiting for the return of the policeman,
a vivid picture of his rescuer in his mind.
The boy had worn a cap pulled far down over his
eyes. He seemed young, yet Frank recalled that
he wore a moustache.</p>

<p>“I’d like to give him something for saving me
the loss of all that money,” said Frank. “The
poor fellow looked as if he needed it. Any trace
of the man, sir?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the policeman, coming back
from a fruitless search. “Better keep nearer the
lights, young fellow. All kinds of rough characters
hang around here, on the lookout for somebody
to rob.”</p>

<p>Frank walked with the policeman to the depot
rotunda. He stayed outside, however. Once or
twice he walked the whole breadth of the rotunda,
peering down the passenger tracks and wishing he
could find the boy who had beaten off the thief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is some one now,” suddenly exclaimed
Frank to himself.</p>

<p>He made a dash down a lonely platform and
ran across a couple of tracks.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s him,” declared Frank. “Hey, just a
minute. Why, what are you running away from
me for?”</p>

<p>The person Frank was after had started up
quickly at the first hail. Frank overtook him, cornering
him where some milk cars blocked the way
south.</p>

<p>The strange boy braced back against the side
of a car, pulled his cap down further over his
eyes, and said.</p>

<p>“Want me?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I want you,” cried Frank spiritedly.
“First, to shake hands with you and thank you
for your bravery in my behalf.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that wasn’t anything,” observed the
strange boy.</p>

<p>“No, only the saving of all the money I’ve got
in the world,” retorted Frank.</p>

<p>He shook the boy’s hand warmly. The latter
at last slightly returned the hand pressure, but
kept looking about him furtively and uneasily.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Frank, “what was that you
hit that man with?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“A loose-jointed ventilator slide bar I found on
top of the coach.”</p>

<p>“And, if I may ask, what was you ever doing
perched up there?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you must know, I was waiting for the
train to start out. In fact,” confessed the speaker
in a low, constrained tone, “beating my way, stealing
a ride.”</p>

<p>“Where to?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;anywhere, anywhere away from the
city.”</p>

<p>The boy said this in such a forlorn way that
Frank felt there was some pathetic cause for the
despair expressed.</p>

<p>“You ran away from the policeman, too,” suggested
Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, he wouldn’t have much use for my kind,”
observed the boy.</p>

<p>Frank was silent for a moment, intensely studying
as far as the dim light would allow the figure
and face of his companion.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“My name&mdash;oh,” sort of stammered the boy,
“why, it’s Markham.”</p>

<p>“Well, Markham,” said Frank very kindly,
placing a gentle hand on the lad’s arm, “you and
I should be good friends. Don’t edge away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
me. You say you were trying to get out of the
city. Had you no idea of where you were bound
for?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere, but the country. Some place where
I’d be safe&mdash;I mean where they couldn’t find&mdash;that
is, oh, just to get to some quiet little country
town where I could get work.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got the town and I’ll guarantee the work,”
cried Frank heartily, slapping Markham on the
shoulder. “See here, no secrets between friends
now. You’ve got no money, or you wouldn’t be
riding on car tops.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough,” admitted the boy, forcing
a laugh.</p>

<p>“And maybe you’re hungry.”</p>

<p>There was no reply to this, but Markham’s
eager eyes strayed in the direction of the lighted
waiting room and its gleaming coffee tank and
polished lunch counter.</p>

<p>“Come on,” urged Frank, keeping up a cheery,
good-fellow air. “I’m ready for a bite, too.”</p>

<p>Markham held back as Frank tried to pull him
along with him.</p>

<p>“See here&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Newton&mdash;Frank Newton, that’s me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t go with you. In the first place,
I’m a sight for respectable people. In the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
place,” went on Markham, “there’s some people I
don’t want to risk meeting.”</p>

<p>Frank reflected for a moment or two.</p>

<p>“Will you stay here for five minutes till I come
back?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, if you want me to,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“All right. Be sure, now.”</p>

<p>Frank was gone less than the five minutes. He
returned with a little tin pail holding a pint of hot
coffee, a picnic plate containing two sandwiches, a
piece of pie and some doughnuts.</p>

<p>“There, try that,” he said, placing the things
on a bumper post.</p>

<p>“Say,” choked up Markham&mdash;but Frank
strode away, whistling to himself. He did not approach
Markham until every vestige of the lunch
had disappeared.</p>

<p>“That’s the first square meal I’ve had for two
days,” said Markham in a grateful, contented tone.
“Say, you’re good.”</p>

<p>“Am I?” smiled Frank. “I’m good for your
railroad fare to where I live, and a job right on top
of it for you, if you say so.”</p>

<p>“Do you honestly mean that?” asked Markham,
almost solemnly, his voice quite tremulous.</p>

<p>“Every word of it,” declared Frank. “I live
at Greenville. It’s about a hundred and fifty miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
down state. Say the word, Markham. I can see
you’re in trouble or distress of some kind. I’m not
prying to find out what it is. I only want to show
what I think of you for saving my money, and
maybe my life with a courage that has got to belong
to a first-class fellow.”</p>

<p>Markham bowed his head as if in deep thought.
Frank saw a tear fall to the platform. Finally his
companion spoke again.</p>

<p>“If you will advance my fare,” he said, “I’ll
pay you back first money I earn.”</p>

<p>“That’s a bargain,” said Frank. “Come on.
We’ll buy your ticket right now.”</p>

<p>“No,” demurred Markham, holding back in a
timorous way. “You get both tickets. I’ll be
somewhere on the train. I’d rather sort of hang
around the smoker and the platforms till we get
beyond the city limits.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Frank.</p>

<p>He had a vague idea in his mind that Markham
was afraid to show himself publicly in the city, for
some reason or other. Frank even speculated as
to the possibility of Markham being disguised.
He looked, acted and talked like a boy about his
own age. The moustache, however, suggested
that he was a young man of about twenty.</p>

<p>Frank made his new acquaintance promise positively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
he would be on the train. He went back to
the depot and bought another ticket to Greenville.
He was somewhat anxious and impatient
until the train started up.</p>

<p>There was a first stop at the limits of the city.
Just as the train steamed ahead again, some one
entered at the rear door of the coach.</p>

<p>“Hello&mdash;good,” exclaimed Frank, as Markham
quietly sat down in the seat beside him.
“Why&mdash;”</p>

<p>Frank paused there, staring at his fellow-passenger.
Markham had washed the grime from
his face. He no longer wore the cap pulled down
over his eyes. Looking bright as a dollar, he
smiled, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Pretty grimy, wasn’t I?” he laughed.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” stammered the puzzled Frank, “but
say&mdash;what has become of your moustache?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>A BOY WITH A MYSTERY</small></h2>


<p>The boy who called himself Markham flushed
scarlet at Frank’s sudden words. His hand went
with a quick, nervous movement to his upper lip.
He looked dreadfully embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Frank abruptly, trying to
make it easy for the young fellow. “You look
better without it.”</p>

<p>Markham had gained time now to cover his confusion.
He swallowed a lump in his throat and
smiled feebly.</p>

<p>“You see,” he stammered somewhat, “that
wasn’t a real moustache&mdash;that one I’ve dropped.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wasn’t it?” said Frank.</p>

<p>“No. How I happened to have it was this,”
explained Markham, rather lamely, but with apparent
truth. “See?” and he produced from a
pocket two false moustaches and as many small
goatees. “Fact is, I wanted to earn some money.
I saw a peddler selling those things on a street
corner. They went like hot cakes. I asked him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
where he bought them. He told me, said he had
taken them up only temporarily to make a little
pocket money. He was nearly sold out, and offered
me about a dozen of them for a quarter. I
sold nearly all of them, and then went to the address
he gave me to stock up again. They
wouldn’t sell under a gross&mdash;three dollars and
sixty cents, I think the price was. I didn’t have
that much, so my scheme fell down.”</p>

<p>Markham now took a printed circular from his
pocket, as if to verify his statement. Frank
glanced over it with increasing interest. It advertised
a city firm supplying street peddlers with all
kinds of goods.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Frank, “I noticed a man selling
these same articles on a street corner. It’s a pretty
catchy novelty with boys and young men.”</p>

<p>“It is, for a fact,” declared Markham. “Look
here: did you ever see ‘Teddy’s Teeth?’ That’s
an old novelty&mdash;look.”</p>

<p>Markham produced and put in his mouth a row
of false teeth, welted the reverse side of a moustache,
placed it on his upper lip, a minute black dab
of hair on his chin, and turned for inspection to
Frank.</p>

<p>The latter laughed heartily. The transformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
from Markham’s natural face was immense.</p>

<p>“You have no idea how those things catch people
the first time they see them,” said Markham.
“I’ve noticed that fellows from the country buy
best. Say, if I had a gross of them, I bet I could
sell them in two days, down your way.”</p>

<p>“I think you could, too, Markham,” replied
Frank, “and you have set me thinking on an entirely
new business proposition. Can I keep this
circular?”</p>

<p>“Surely, if it’s any use to you.”</p>

<p>“It may be,” said Frank, “in fact, I think I
shall order a gross as soon as I get home, just to
experiment on.”</p>

<p>“Going peddling?” insinuated Markham.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ll tell you,” answered Frank. “Settle
down comfortably, and we’ll chat a little. It
will do me good to talk out what’s continually on
my mind. More than that, I shouldn’t wonder if
you, with all your experience, could give me some
very valuable points. The long and short of it is,
I am going into the mail order business.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said his companion wistfully, “isn’t that
grand.”</p>

<p>Frank told his new friend all about himself, his
business and his hopes and plans. The other listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
with great attention. When Frank had finished
talking, Markham showed by his expression
of face that he considered him a pretty smart business
boy.</p>

<p>“If you can afford to hang around with me till
I get my bearings,” added Frank, “I’ll guarantee
you a comfortable home anyway, and good money
if you know how to earn it.”</p>

<p>Markham’s eyes grew big with excitement.
Then his face fell, as he said:</p>

<p>“I’d like nothing better in the world, but business
men don’t hire strangers without a recommendation.
I can give none. I’ll be square with you.
My name isn’t Markham at all. I can’t tell you
my real one until maybe a long, long time. I wore
that moustache partly as a disguise.”</p>

<p>“Well, all that is your business, Markham,”
said Frank.</p>

<p>“I know that, but it must look suspicious to
you. If I told you that I am leaving the city to
get away from some one who is hunting me, would
you feel like trusting me much?”</p>

<p>Frank took his companion’s hand in his own and
looked him straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>“Markham,” he said, “I am willing to put entire
confidence in you. I owe you that much,
surely. Your secrets are not my business, I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
like to ask one question only: You haven’t run
away from home, have you?”</p>

<p>“I have no home,” answered Markham in a
subdued tone.</p>

<p>“An orphan?” insinuated Frank, gently.</p>

<p>“No, my father is living. He is in the Philippines.
He will be out of service next January.
All I am waiting for is for him to get back to this
country to right my wrongs.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about it, Markham,” said Frank,
observing deep sadness and distress shadow the
bright face of his companion. “You come home
with me. I’ve got so good a mother she will welcome
you gladly.”</p>

<p>“But I want to work,” said Markham.</p>

<p>“Haven’t I got work waiting ready for you,
and lots of it, too?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p>“That’s so, is it?” said Markham, brightening
up. “My! to be away&mdash;away from the city in
a quiet, beautiful town. Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
You are the first real friend I’ve found in six
months, and&mdash;I can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right&mdash;get rid of all your old troubles,”
said Frank, and he did not think the less of
his new friend because he had a good, solid cry.
“There’s nothing but sunshine ahead for you, if I
can help you any.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank warmed to the boy as they continued
their conversation. A dark spell seemed to lift
from Markham’s spirit, each mile accomplished
away from the great city that appeared to hold
some secret, haunting dread for him.</p>

<p>“Greenville,” announced Frank heartily at
length&mdash;“and home.”</p>

<p>The hour was late, the streets deserted, but, as
they strolled away from the little railroad depot,
Markham walked like a person in some rapt
dream. He drew in great luxurious breaths of
the flower-perfumed air. He viewed pretty moonlit
lawns and gardens as if he were looking at some
fascinating picture.</p>

<p>“Like it, do you?” smiled Frank.</p>

<p>“I love the country. I always did,” replied
Markham. “This is just grand to me. Look
here, now,” he continued, “you had better let me
stow myself in some friendly haystack or under
some hedge till morning. Don’t disturb your
mother to-night about me.”</p>

<p>“Disturb her?” said Frank. “No danger of
her going to bed till I show up, if it’s till morning.
There we are&mdash;there’s the light in the window
for us, Markham.”</p>

<p>Frank led his friend upstairs over the store.
Markham lagged behind until the greetings between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
mother and son were over. He stepped a
little timidly forward, as he heard Frank say:</p>

<p>“Mother, I have brought a friend home with
me. This is my mother, Markham.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ismond received the homeless boy with a
sweet, welcoming smile that won his heart entirely.
She told Frank to take him into the sitting room
while she herself hustled about the kitchen. Frank
left Markham long enough to join his mother and
tell her what he owed to his new companion.</p>

<p>“It’s late,” said Mrs. Ismond a few minutes
later, “but you must eat a good meal after your
long, busy day, and I positively will wake up nobody
in this house until nine o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p>There were only two beds in the house. Frank
shared his with Markham. The latter wore a
happy smile on his face as he stretched himself out
luxuriously.</p>

<p>“That supper!” he said, in a rapturous sort of a
way. “This nice comfortable bed! I’ve got to
shut my eyes for fear it will all turn out a dream.”</p>

<p>Frank was glad to lie thinking for a spell undisturbed.
His companion fell into a profound, exhausted
slumber. Mrs. Ismond retired, and the
house was all quiet at last.</p>

<p>Like a panorama all the varied events of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
preceding twenty-four hours passed vividly
through Frank’s mind. He felt greatly satisfied
with the outcome of his visit to the city.</p>

<p>Then Frank began to scan the future, his plans,
his ambitions. He felt truly rich with his little
money capital, the present work in hand, the mail
order lists, the apple corer, and other things.</p>

<p>“How sick that man is of his apple corer,”
mused Frank. “There are over five thousand of
the crude, unsatisfactory things in that big box
down stairs. He had a good idea all right, but
didn’t know how to apply it. He gave it&mdash;to&mdash;me&mdash;be&mdash;”</p>

<p>There Frank drifted into a doze. It was
strange, but he half-dreamed, half-thought out
some wonderful transformation of the hardware
man’s invention, and, all of a sudden, in a lightning
flash, a great, surging idea swept through his
brain with tremendous force.</p>

<p>It lifted him out of his sleep half-dazed, he gave
a jump from the bed to the floor. There he wavered,
rubbing his eyes, and then irresistibly shouting
out:</p>

<p>“Eureka&mdash;I’ve found it!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>A GOOD START</small></h2>


<p>Frank did not go to sleep again, he couldn’t.
As he lay there, it seemed to him as though every
nerve in his body was wide awake and on a terrific
tension.</p>

<p>Frank had heard of some of the great inventions
of the world discovered in a dream. Had he, too,
in a dream, or a half-waking doze, had the same
experience.</p>

<p>“It came like a flash,” he reflected. “It’s plain
as day now. The apple corer improved, remodeled,
in perfect working order and a success.
Oh, I simply can’t lie here.”</p>

<p>Frank wriggled and tossed restlessly. Then,
when he was certain that Markham was asleep
again, he slipped quietly out of bed, put on part
of his clothes and glided noiselessly downstairs.</p>

<p>Frank softly closed the store door communicating
with the hallway. He lit a lamp and went over
to a counter containing the great heap of apple
corers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>He selected one, got a sheet of tin and a pair of
stovepipe shears, and became engrossed in cutting
out and forming cones, funnels and all kinds of
odd-shaped contrivances.</p>

<p>For fully two hours Frank was working at his
task. He seemed to be supplying the crude apple
corer with an inner sheath, to which he had supplied
a small three-bladed device. He turned it
about, altered it, worked over it, and a broad smile
of satisfaction stole across his face as he progressed.</p>

<p>“Frank, this is not sleeping.”</p>

<p>Frank looked up from his task, quite startled, to
find his mother standing a few feet away, watching
him.</p>

<p>“I know it isn’t, mother,” he responded gaily.
“It’s work, good work, too, so it couldn’t wait.”</p>

<p>“But, Frank&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Listen, mother,” he said, “I have dreamed out
an invention. Really I have. If my improved apple
corer works as I think it will, this is a lucky
spell of wakefulness. I don’t want to say much
about it till I am sure of it, but I believe I have
invented something practical and of value.”</p>

<p>Frank treasured his little model in his pocket,
and consented to go back to bed now. He was
up bright and early. First thing he was down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
his work shop. At breakfast he was more quiet
than usual. Frank was doing a great deal of
thinking.</p>

<p>“I have certainly got the patent right bee in my
bonnet,” he reflected. “It’s a fascinating little
insect. Ah, Markham, we were going to let you
sleep till you were rested up completely,” added
Frank, as their guest put in an appearance.</p>

<p>Markham was pleasant, polite and contented.
He put some things in order for Mrs. Ismond, offered
to help her with the dishes, and went downstairs
finally to join Frank.</p>

<p>“Now then,” he said briskly, “I’m fed up and
rested up&mdash;what is there to do?”</p>

<p>Frank explained about the needle packages.
He told Markham as well as he could what towns
in the vicinity had been covered.</p>

<p>“There’s a row of little settlements to the east,”
he explained. “You can use my bicycle if you like
and give them a call.”</p>

<p>“This is real life,” jubilated Markham, as he
set off on the wheel with a hundred packages of
the needles done up in a cardboard box.</p>

<p>Frank received visits from several of his boy
employes that morning. Then he set about disposing
of some odds and ends of the salvage
stock about town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>From two till five o’clock he was busy working
on his “patent.” From then until six o’clock he
wrote several letters, went out and mailed them,
and kept thinking and planning on the mail order
business.</p>

<p>Markham, dusty and tired, wheeled up to the
store about seven o’clock. He had an immense
bouquet of wild flowers, which delighted Mrs.
Ismond, to whom he gracefully presented it.</p>

<p>“What a day it has been for me,” he exclaimed,
after a good wash up. “Why, I seem to be free,
really free for the first time in my life&mdash;the pretty
roads, the lovely flowers, the sweet singing
birds&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And the needles?” suggested practical Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh, I sold them before noon,” said Markham,
indifferently.</p>

<p>“All of them?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen packages to one little country store.
Knocked a cent off my profit, but time counts, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I sent an order to the city for a gross of those
false moustaches,” announced Frank.</p>

<p>“You did?” exclaimed Markham. “That’s
famous! When will they be here?”</p>

<p>“Day after to-morrow, I think. Then I’m going
down to Riverton to collect some bills. I calculate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
it will take about three days to clean up the
lot. Mother, you must run the business here while
I’m gone. We will have to stay at Riverton
nights.”</p>

<p>“Shall I keep on with the needles?” asked
Markham.</p>

<p>“Yes, but not here. We will make Riverton
headquarters for this trip. You can come with me,
and try the false moustaches on the community.”</p>

<p>“Some needles, too,” said Markham. “I’ll
guarantee to sell a gross of the moustaches in two
days.”</p>

<p>Markham did quite as well the second day as he
had the first. It pleased Frank to note how he
seemed emerging from a worried-looking, distressed
refugee into a bright, laughing, happy boy.
Mrs. Ismond had taken a great liking to him, and
he seemed never tired of helping Frank with his
chores clear up to bed time.</p>

<p>The moustaches arrived the next afternoon.
They had a merry evening, Markham applying
moustache, goatee and false teeth to his face, and
giving character imitations thus disguised, which
he had seen at some show.</p>

<p>Frank hired a light wagon and horse for three
days, and the next morning he and Markham drove
over to Riverton. They arranged for a cheap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
lodging, and separated. Frank had routed the
bills he had to collect systematically. The first
batch took in a twenty miles circuit among farmers.</p>

<p>When evening came he had presented bills
amounting to about two hundred dollars. As the
horse walked slowly back the road to Riverton,
Frank figured out the day’s results.</p>

<p>“Pretty good,” he said, running over the paper
slips in a package. “I have collected forty-four
dollars and eighty cents&mdash;got twenty dollars in
sixty days’ notes, four promises to pay, four people
call again, three parties moved away, and six
bills no good.”</p>

<p>Frank drove leisurely down the principal street
of Riverton, bound for the livery stable where he
had arranged to put up the horse during their sojourn
in town.</p>

<p>He halted with some curiosity and amusement
at a corner where a crowd was gathered.
Mounted on a dry goods box, Markham was addressing
a large and jolly audience.</p>

<p>He was giving character sketches in a really entertaining
way. After every sally of laughter he
would ply his wares. Everybody seemed buying.</p>

<p>“He’s a bright fellow and a first-class peddler,”
Frank reflected, as he continued on his way, unobserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
by the friend he had started in business.</p>

<p>“All sold out and the public hungry for more,”
announced Markham, as he joined Frank on agreement
at a restaurant. “Those false teeth also.
I’ll bet fifty people asked for them. Say, it would
pay to wire a quick duplicate order on the moustaches
and a gross of the teeth. I can certainly sell
the outfit before we leave this town.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see if I can’t arrange it,” said Frank, and
after supper he did so. Frank got track of a purchasing
agent, who for a small commission went
daily from Riverton to the city, bringing back with
him what light stuff he could carry in his two
valises&mdash;all the baggage the railroad company
would allow through free.</p>

<p>Just at dusk Saturday evening the two friends
started cheerily homewards. Frank had made exactly
thirty-eight dollars for his three days’ work.
Markham’s profits amounted to a little over seventeen
dollars.</p>

<p>“I want you to be my banker, Frank,” he said.
“Haven’t I done quite well? Next week I’ll cut
a still wider swath.”</p>

<p>“Not peddling, Markham,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Why not?” inquired Markham, in some surprise.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you. To-night about closes up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
what business I have in hand. You know all my
hopes and plans tend towards starting a mail order
business. We would soon exhaust this district,
selling on a small scale. I want to reach a wider
one. I have found out what takes with the public.
Next week I am going to gather together
what we have, and move to another town.”</p>

<p>Markham’s face fell. He looked a trifle uneasy.</p>

<p>“Nearer the city?” he asked, in quite an anxious
tone.</p>

<p>“No, nearly a hundred and fifty miles north of
here. The fact is, Markham, I am going to move
to Pleasantville. I have some rare, royal friends
there. Two of them, Darry and Bob Haven, are
in the printing business. They own and publish a
weekly newspaper. They can help me immensely.
Then there is a mightier reason, too, for locating
at Pleasantville.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Frank?” asked the interested
Markham.</p>

<p>“A man named Dawes runs a novelty factory
there&mdash;makes all kinds of little hardware specialties.
It is just the place to manufacture my apple
corer, if it is a success. If it is not, I can advertise
the list he already manufactures, and get up
something else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s a good deal of money in those little
devices when a fellow gets up the right thing, I
suppose?” asked Markham.</p>

<p>“Sure, anything new and handy goes great,” responded
Frank. “I have read of a dozen little
simple inventions that have made a great fortune
for the owners.”</p>

<p>Markham was studiously silent for a few minutes.
Then he asked:</p>

<p>“Do they make things in wire at that Pleasantville
factory&mdash;I mean, do they have the material
and machinery to make wire things?”</p>

<p>“If not, they can easily get them,” answered
Frank. “Why do you ask, Markham?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Markham, with a little conscious
laugh, “the truth is, I have invented something myself.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>A MEAN ENEMY</small></h2>


<p>“You have invented something yourself?” repeated
Frank, with a good deal of curiosity.</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Markham.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“A puzzle.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a puzzle?” pressed Frank.</p>

<p>“I’ll show it to you,” said Markham, fishing
in his pocket. “There it is. I don’t suppose it’s
much,” he continued in a deprecating way,
“though two or three fellows who saw it said it
was quite clever.”</p>

<p>Frank inspected the article his companion now
handed him with a good deal of interest. It was
roughly made of wire. There was a ring linked
into a triangle, and the latter linked onto two other
rings. The lower one of these had a link connected
with a wire square. Lying loose around
this link was a larger ring of wire.</p>

<p>“What’s the puzzle?” inquired Frank, looking
over the little device.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“To get that big ring over all the other rings,
the little square and the triangle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” said Frank, working at the device
industriously, but finally asking: “Can it be
done?”</p>

<p>“Readily&mdash;look here,” and Markham, taking
the puzzle, deftly slipped the ring over all the obstacles,
and then worked it back again into its
original place.</p>

<p>“I say, that is mighty clever,” declared Frank.
“Show me slower, now. The slip over the triangle
is the trick, eh? Good! Markham, that
thing would sell like hot cakes.”</p>

<p>“Think so?” asked Markham, seriously.</p>

<p>“I certainly do. If I was started in the mail
order business, I wouldn’t hesitate to illustrate and
advertise it in my catalogue.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Markham, “that pleases me, for I
can show in a small way my appreciation of all
your kindness to me. Frank, I give it to you. If
it’s worth patenting, all right. I know it’s original.
It’s yours, freely.”</p>

<p>“On royalty&mdash;yes,” answered Frank. “I’ll
have some nicely finished models made when we
get to Pleasantville. We’re getting to be great
business men, aren’t we, Markham, talking about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
patents and royalties? How did you come to
make the thing, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was for&mdash;for a long time in a place
where there was lots of wire,” explained Markham
lamely. “I had too much leisure. It bored me.
I had to find something to work at to kill time.”</p>

<p>The old gloom that Frank did not like came into
the boy’s face as he spoke. Frank drifted off into
generalizations on his mail order dreams to lead his
mind into more pleasant channels.</p>

<p>There was a great confab at the supper table that
evening. Frank told his mother all his plans in
detail. She had too much confidence in his good
judgment to oppose his wishes.</p>

<p>“I will be glad to get anywhere away from a
place where I have seen so much sorrow,” she said.
“Besides that, the Haven boys and Bart Stirling
and their friends are certainly good friends of
yours. Has my son ever told you of the lives he
saved at the great fire at the Pleasantville hotel?”
Mrs. Ismond asked of Markham.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, mother,” said Frank&mdash;“don’t go
to lionizing me, now.”</p>

<p>His mother was fondly persistent, however, and
Markham, with gleaming eyes, was soon reading
a treasured newspaper clipping telling of Frank’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
heroic exploit, as already related in detail in “Two
Boy Publishers.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” he exclaimed with enthusiasm,
“and I’m proud to know your son, Mrs. Ismond.”</p>

<p>The next day Frank wrote a report to Mr. Morton
about the collections. He returned the unpaid
bills with notations as to the condition of each
claim, explaining that he was going to move to a
distant town, and naming Mr. Buckner as a reliable
man to follow up the collections.</p>

<p>Frank saw their lawyer, Mr. Beach. The attorney
stated that their suit against Dorsett would
not be tried for over a year. He took Mrs. Ismond’s
new address, and promised to look out for
her interests.</p>

<p>Then Frank arranged to sell off some of their
furniture. It took two days to pack up the rest.
Tuesday morning early all arrangements had been
completed for their removal. They had engaged
a freight car to carry their belongings to Pleasantville.</p>

<p>Frank closed up his business with Nelson Cady
and the other boys. The old store building was
vacated. Markham was to go with them to Pleasantville.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ismond was to spend the day until train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
time with an old neighbor. Frank and Markham
were also invited there to dinner.</p>

<p>They had just finished the meal. Frank was
looking over a time-table and telling of a letter he
had received from Darry Haven that morning,
when there came a thundering knock at the front
door.</p>

<p>“Frank,” said Mrs. Ismond, in quite a startled
tone, as her hostess opened the front door, “it is
that man, Mr. Dorsett.”</p>

<p>“Is the widow Ismond here?” demanded Dorsett’s
gruff tones.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ismond is here, yes,” replied her friend.
“Won’t you come in, sir?”</p>

<p>“No,” sneered Dorsett, “short and sweet is my
errand.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of my mother, Mr. Dorsett?”
demanded Frank, stepping to the open
doorway.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re here, are you?” snarled Dorsett.</p>

<p>“Frank, do not have any words with him,”
spoke Mrs. Ismond, hastening to her son’s side.</p>

<p>Dorsett stood outside. With him was a low-browed
fellow whom Frank recognized as a
chronic hanger-on about the village justice’s place.</p>

<p>“I’ve come&mdash;with my deputy and witness,
ma’am,” announced Dorsett, “to inform you that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
I have learned that you are about to leave town.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is correct,” answered Mrs. Ismond.</p>

<p>“Very well, then here,” and he produced a legal-looking
slip of paper, “is a little bill you will have
to settle first.”</p>

<p>“We owe you nothing that I am aware of,”
said Mrs. Ismond.</p>

<p>“Mistake,” snapped Dorsett. “When I sued
on my claim to your homestead, I entered judgment
against you for the costs of court. There’s
the amount&mdash;fifty-seven dollars.”</p>

<p>“And not satisfied with robbing me of my home
and my income, in fact everything I had in the
world, you have the heartlessness to press such a
claim as this at such a time?” asked Mrs. Ismond
bitterly.</p>

<p>“Law is law,” prated the mean old usurer.</p>

<p>“Why have you never mentioned this before?”
demanded Frank, his eyes flashing dangerously.</p>

<p>“Because, you insolent young snip,” retorted old
Dorsett, “I wanted to pay you off for some of your
fine airs.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Dorsett,” said Mrs. Ismond, “I
shall contest this unjust claim.”</p>

<p>“All right,” jeered Dorsett, retreating down
the steps, and beckoning to his companion, “then
within thirty minutes I’ll put an embargo on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
leaving the county until I have my money, according
to law.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ismond sunk to a chair quite pale and distressed.</p>

<p>“Frank,” she gasped in a frightened way,
“what is he going to do?”</p>

<p>“Some mean trick, be sure of that,” said
Frank. “Mother, I’ll stay here ten years but I
will never pay that outrageous claim.”</p>

<p>“Be assured I would never let you,” replied his
mother, firmly.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew what he was up to?” murmured
Frank in a troubled way.</p>

<p>“Leave that for me to find out for you,” said
Markham briskly, bolting from the house like a
shot.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>A PIECE OF CHALK</small></h2>


<p>Frank Newton had said that Markham was
a first-class peddler. If he had followed his young
friend as he darted from the house, he would also
have noted him quite a proficient amateur detective.</p>

<p>Markham looked down the street after the retreating
figures of old Dorsett and his companion.
He saw they were bound for the business centre of
the town. He cut down an alley, and heading
them off allowed them to pass him by and quietly
followed on their trail.</p>

<p>When they went up into a building occupied as
offices for a justice of the peace and lawyers,
Markham in a few moments trailed after them.</p>

<p>Loitering about the hall, he could watch them
conversing with a village magistrate at his desk.
The latter consulted a copy of the statutes, expounded
some point under discussion, and finally
filled out several legal blanks.</p>

<p>Markham was industriously reading the notices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
tacked to the justice’s bulletin board outside of his
office door, as Dorsett came out of the room.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Sherry,” he said to his companion.
“I’ll settle with you now.”</p>

<p>“All right, governor,” bobbed the man.</p>

<p>“You are deputized to serve these papers.
Don’t get them mixed. Got any tacks?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get some all right.”</p>

<p>“Very well. When you have disposed of the
first two documents, serve the last one on Mrs.
Ismond, see?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I see, governor&mdash;ah, and glad to see
this five-dollar bill. First one I’ve seen, in fact,
for an age.”</p>

<p>“When you’re all through, report to me.”</p>

<p>“I will, governor.”</p>

<p>They kept together till they reached the street.
Arrived there, Dorsett went one way, his hireling
another.</p>

<p>Markham put after the latter, who was so elated
over the possession of money that he chuckled and
swung along the street with a great air of importance
and enjoyment.</p>

<p>The man Sherry went straight to the railway depot.
Markham, looking in through one of its
windows, saw him approach the station agent. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
him Sherry read one of the documents and came
out again.</p>

<p>The second day of Markham’s residence in
Greenville, he had done quite an heroic act. It had
made the railroad men his friends. One of their
number had celebrated pay day too freely. He
had stumbled across a track.</p>

<p>Markham had run at the top of his speed, and
had even risked life and limb to reach him in time
to drag him out of the way of a freight train backing
down upon him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Young,” said Markham, running into the
depot by one side door as Sherry left it by another,
“you remember me?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I do. How are you?” said the depot
master heartily.</p>

<p>“I’m worried to death to find out what that man
who was just here is up to,” said Markham, hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Up to? Down to, you mean,” flared out
Young. “He’s served a paper on me as the representative
of the railway company, notifying me
that we are to hold the car containing Mrs. Ismond’s
furniture until the matter of a debt she
owes old Dorsett is settled in court.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ismond does not rightfully owe him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
cent,” asserted Markham. “It’s a mean, malicious
trick of the old reprobate to persecute my
friend, Frank Newton. Can they stop the car?”</p>

<p>The station agent shrugged his shoulders dubiously.</p>

<p>“They won’t get any help from me,” he said.
“That man asked me where the car was. I told
him to find out&mdash;I wasn’t hunting for it. I’d like
nothing better than to delay him for two hours.
By five o’clock the north freights will have left
the yards. Once out of the county, that furniture
would be safe.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Markham. “I’ll see what
I can do.”</p>

<p>He ran out of the depot forthwith. Sherry had
crossed the road. Markham saw him coming out
of one of the taverns lining the street in that immediate
vicinity.</p>

<p>Sherry had one or two men with him with whom
he had evidently been treating. They walked
along with him until they reached another haunt
of the same class, and went in there.</p>

<p>Markham got in a doorway near the entrance to
the place. In a few minutes Sherry came out to
the street.</p>

<p>He had his hat stuck back and his head up by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
this time, and was officious and blatant in his manner.</p>

<p>“I’d like to stay with you, boys,” he announced.
“Join you later. Got a big responsibility on my
shoulders just now.”</p>

<p>“That so?” smirked one of the hangers on.</p>

<p>“You bet. See that paper?” and Sherry produced
a document.</p>

<p>“We see it.”</p>

<p>“I can tie up the whole railroad system here if
I want to,” he bragged.</p>

<p>Markham hurried off in the direction of the
freight tracks. There was a wide crossing where
the sidings began. A flagman guarded this.
Markham ran up to him. This man, as he knew,
was a brother of the railroader he had saved from
being run over by the freight train.</p>

<p>“Mr. Boyce,” said Markham, “will you do me
a favor?”</p>

<p>“Sure, will I,” cried the flagman. “We’re a
whole family of friends to you, boy.”</p>

<p>“All right. Have you got a piece of chalk&mdash;the
kind they use for marking on the cars?”</p>

<p>“Dozens of it. Here’s a handful, my hearty,”
and the flagman darted into the little shanty and
out again with a fistful of great chunks of chalk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” said Markham, selecting a piece.
“Now then, do you see that man coming down the
track?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded the flagman.</p>

<p>“He will ask you about the out freights, maybe
about some particular car. It’s the car holding
Frank Newton’s furniture that he’s after&mdash;their
household goods they’re shipping to Pleasantville.”</p>

<p>“Aha,” nodded Boyce.</p>

<p>“I will be in sight,” went on Markham, rapidly.
“Point me out to him. Say I can tell him,
will you?”</p>

<p>“But what for&mdash;no, that’s all right. I will,
I will,” pledged the flagman.</p>

<p>Markham ran down a siding. He was busy
about a certain car for a few minutes. As, after
interviewing the flagman, Sherry came that way, he
discovered Markham seated on top of a locked
box car idly kicking his heels against its side.</p>

<p>“Hey, hello,” hailed Sherry&mdash;“this the out
freights?”</p>

<p>“How should I know?” muttered Markham.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know you. You’re the fellow who
trains with young Newton. Of course you’d be
here, and of course this is the car. Yes,” decided
Sherry, scanning its side. “Sure. Here’s the
destination marked in chalk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Sherry read the sprawling writing: “7-23,
Pleasantville,” marked across the locked door of
the car, and pulled out a document.</p>

<p>“That’s the way we do it,” he said in a boastful
chuckle, picking up a coupling pin and using it
to hammer some tacks through the paper.
“There you are. In the name of the law this
car seized in transit, ipse dixit, e pluribus unum,
according to the statoots therein pervided. Quite a
lawyer, hey? Boy, it’s a life sentence to tamper
with that car till the judge says move her.”</p>

<p>“It is?” said Markham, tranquilly.</p>

<p>The big braggart swaggered away. Markham
jumped down, watched him out of sight, jumped
up and cracked his heels together. Then with his
handkerchief he rubbed off the destination mark
that had deluded old Dorsett’s boisterous and self-important
emissary.</p>

<p>Then Markham chuckled as he glanced at the
document tacked to the car door. He now moved
over to a line of made-up freights on another track.
He lingered in their vicinity for over an hour.</p>

<p>When he had seen an engine run on a caboose
and then switch to the head of the train, Markham,
with a good deal of complacency in his face,
started back to join his friends.</p>

<p>As he neared the house where he had left Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Ismond and Frank, he noticed a man leave the
place. It was Sherry.</p>

<p>“All right,” announced Markham, breaking in
upon his friends a moment later. “I’ve found
out what old Dorsett is up to.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so have we,” answered Frank, who stood
by the side of his mother, who was looking down
dejectedly. “They have just notified us that the
car containing our furniture is attached.”</p>

<p>“That so?” said Markham, with a broad smile.
“Well, what are you going to do, Frank?”</p>

<p>“We can’t leave Greenville, that’s all,” said
Frank, with a sigh. “Mother, I’ll go down to
the station and get the money back for our tickets.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” cried Markham, “you won’t do any
such thing. How soon does that train leave,
Frank?”</p>

<p>“In half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Well, get your traps together. You’re going
to take that train all right.”</p>

<p>“Why, what are you talking about?” demanded
Frank, staring at Markham in wonder.</p>

<p>“I mean that fellow who was just here has made
a mess of it,” said Markham. “He’s attached a
car all right, but not your car.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir-ree! Your car, my dear Frank, I am
happy to tell you, is by this time twenty miles over
the county line whirling on its way to Pleasantville.
Hip, hip, hurrah!”</p>

<p>“See here, Markham,” said Frank, seriously,
seizing his friend’s arm in an endeavor to cure his
jubilant antics. “What have you been up to.”</p>

<p>“Me? Nothing,” declared Markham, assuming
the vacant bumpkin look he expressed so well
when he gave a character delineation. “It’s old
Dorsett’s emissary who was up to something&mdash;up
to the wrong car, see? He has tacked that attachment
notice onto a poor innocent old car filled
with ballasting cinders. Never mind now. I’ll
tell you later. Don’t miss the train, Frank.”</p>

<p>There were hurried good-byes to their kind-hearted
neighbor. Frank and Markham, each
carrying two satchels, piloted Mrs. Ismond to the
railroad station.</p>

<p>Just as the train came in from the south a man
drove past the depot platform. He drew up his
horse with a jerk. It was Dorsett.</p>

<p>He stared in amazement at the departing trio.
Then suddenly, as if suspecting some trick, he got
out of his gig and hurried across to the train.</p>

<p>Frank had got his mother to a comfortable seat.
The coach window was open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“You leave at your peril, widow Ismond,”
shouted Dorsett. “That stuff of yours is attached.
We’ve stopped the freight car, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All aboard!” sang out the conductor.</p>

<p>“Hold on, stop&mdash;zounds!” yelled Dorsett at
the top of his voice.</p>

<p>He was lifted from his feet suddenly. Some
one rushing down the platform at cyclone speed
had collided with him.</p>

<p>It was Nelson Cady. He was hatless, his hair
flying in the wind, his whole appearance that of
fearful excitement.</p>

<p>“Say, conductor,” he panted out breathlessly.
“Three people just got on the train&mdash;where are
they? Must see Frank Newton!”</p>

<p>“Hi, there, Nelson,” hailed Frank, waving his
hand through the open coach window.</p>

<p>“Oh, jolly!” shouted Nelson, keeping on a run
with the moving train. “See Frank!”</p>

<p>Nelson tugged at his pocket. He pulled out a
white, fluttering sheet of paper.</p>

<p>“Frank, Frank,” his excited tones rang out after
the vanishing train&mdash;“I’ve got my letter at last!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>“FRANK’S MAIL ORDER HOUSE”</small></h2>


<p>“Gentlemen, you embarrass me.”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!”</p>

<p>“I may say, I am overwhelmed&mdash;overpowered&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Good! Get over it, and give us a speech.”</p>

<p>“No, a toast first. ‘Frank’s Mail Order
House.’ Stet, fill up the sparking glasses once
more.”</p>

<p>“Hip, hurrah! Success to Frank Newton and
his new business venture.”</p>

<p>A merry friendly party was gathered about a
long folding table in the middle of a spacious room.
There were seven of them, and they were having a
jolly good time. An acceptable lunch graced the
banqueting board. Attired in a neat waiter’s
apron and entering heart and soul into the enjoyment
of the occasion, Stet, general utility boy for
Haven Bros., helped the guests from a great pail
of ice cold lemonade, and made himself generally
useful about the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>This was Pleasantville, where Frank Newton,
his mother, and Markham had arrived just one
week previous. The room in which Frank’s
friends were giving him a welcome was located on
the lower floor of the old building that Haven
Bros. had transformed into a print shop in their
early amateur publishing career.</p>

<p>Long since the firm of Haven Bros. had risen
to the dignity of occupying quarters right next to
the <i>Eagle</i>, on the main street of the village.</p>

<p>They had a lease of the old quarters, however.
When Frank came again upon the scene a joint
committee of his loyal friends had met in executive
session to see what they could do to put him on his
feet.</p>

<p>This old structure stood back from the street,
but had a pleasing lawn and flower beds on either
side of the broad walk approaching it. The building
was just off the principal Pleasantville thoroughfare.</p>

<p>There were two large rooms on the lower floor
and a spacious store room above. The Havens
and Bart Stirling had fitted up one of the lower
rooms as an office. Bob Haven had donated a
desk and several chairs. His brother Darry had
put in a table and a file cabinet. Bart had furnished
a neat rug. That evening they had gone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the cottage which Mrs. Ismond had rented, and
had led Frank over to this little surprise party,
comprising themselves, Jim Dunlap, an old printer,
and Baker Mills, also an employe of the
<i>Herald</i>.</p>

<p>Markham was somewhat reticent at first, but
he soon warmed up in response to the free and
hearty spirits surrounding him.</p>

<p>He was immensely interested as the crowd began
to chat on experiences. The story of how
Bart Stirling had risen from a “sub” in a little express
office to assistant manager of a large office,
as already related in “The Young Express
Agent,” was particularly fine to his way of thinking.</p>

<p>The career of the Havens was quite as remarkable.
They now ran the leading weekly newspaper
in Pleasantville, and had a job printing
business that employed two men besides themselves.</p>

<p>Stet, the boy they had rescued from hard usage
and extortion at the hands of their rival, Jasper
Mackey, publisher of the Pleasantville <i>Eagle</i>, had
become a valued fixture with them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Haven, who furnished fashion plates for
some city magazines, got up an original pen and
ink sketch for the <i>Herald</i> each week. The Haven
boys were generally conceded to get out the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
readable weekly newspaper in that section of the
state.</p>

<p>“I declare,” said Frank, with a grateful and a
gratified look about the place, “you fellows have
just about equipped me for business.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not yet,” said Bob Haven. “My sister
is away for a month, and I have arranged to loan
you her typewriter till you can afford to get one of
your own.”</p>

<p>“Say,” broke in Markham, eagerly, “I’m just
at home on that machine.”</p>

<p>“Good for you,” approved Bob. “Then
there’s a painter, here owes us a bill for printing
he never could pay in cash. He’s painting a neat
gold-lettered sign for the front of your place.
‘Frank’s Mail Order House.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” put in Darry, “and I’ve dug out of
storage an upright showcase we took for a debt.
It’s got twelve glass shelves. Set it up at the edge
of the walk with samples of the various articles you
are going to sell, and I’ll warrant many farmer
groups coming to town will drop in to look around
and invest.”</p>

<p>“This is simply immense,” said Frank. “I’m
just bursting with vanity, or self-importance, or
ambition, or something of that sort.”</p>

<p>He briefly outlined his plans to his friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Frank had only that day held a two hours’ consultation
with John Dawes, who owned the novelty
works at the edge of the town.</p>

<p>Dawes made a specialty of manufacturing light
hardware specialties. His own list embraced over
two hundred articles, ranging from pocket rules to
tool chests. He supplied a great many mail order
people all over the country, and told Frank he
would be glad to encourage a local institution.</p>

<p>“He has given me as low a rate as any customer
he has on his books, he says,” reported Frank.
“Besides that, being directly on the spot, I save the
freight charges, you see.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Bart Stirling, “you’ve struck the
right location, sure.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dawes is going to make my apple corer
and a puzzle belonging to Markham,” said Frank.
“Then I have made arrangements with a dozen
large city supply houses. I am going to push that
harmless comical novelty, the false moustache
wrinkle. I have also ordered quite a line of cheap
jewelry, especially initial cuff buttons and friendship
and birthday rings. I can sell at one dollar
and a half a solid gold birthday ring that retailers
everywhere mark at three dollars as a minimum
price. Soon as I get onto all the ropes, I intend
to reach out for class and fraternity emblem trade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
selling on sample, and having the goods made by
a city jewelry manufacturer.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” suddenly broke in Bob Haven to
Markham, who had carelessly slipped on one of the
false moustaches in question. “Heard about your
talent as an entertainer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, give us a round, Markham,” suggested
Bart.</p>

<p>Markham got up on a chair, put on Stet’s cap,
applied goatee and false teeth, and soon had the audience
screaming with hilarity over a very creatable
representation of a stranded actor giving a monologue
in a country grocery store.</p>

<p>The party broke up with congratulatory hand
shakes and all kind of good wishes for the success
of Frank’s new business enterprise.</p>

<p>When Bart and the others had gone, Frank and
Markham looked about their business quarters with
a proud air of satisfaction and comfort.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Frank, those fellows are royal good
friends of yours,” spoke Markham.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Frank with real emotion, “they
have indeed given me the lift they promised me.
We are of poor business material, indeed, if we
cannot make this fine beginning lead to a grand
success. Now then, for a genuine start in the
morning. If you will act as typewriter till we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
afford to hire one, I will fold a batch of our first
circulars.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I will,” said Markham readily.</p>

<p>Bob Haven had brought a thousand circulars
just off the press. Haven Bros. were to do all the
printing for the mail order business. Mrs. Haven
had made several sketches, little inch squares, showing
the false moustache outfit, the wire puzzle, the
initial jewelry and several other minor specialties.
Below followed a list of nearly fifty articles, of
which Frank had a small stock on hand and could
replenish on short order from city supply houses
with which he had made a definite arrangement.</p>

<p>The two boys spread out one of the mailing lists
Frank had got from the salvage stock. Four
boxes containing a thousand envelopes were placed
ready beside the printed circulars. Frank put out
the lights and locked the office door with the care
of a miser securing his treasure.</p>

<p>Markham routed Frank out of bed at five o’clock
the next morning. They arrived at the office by
six. Somewhere Markham had learned the typewriter
perfectly. By four o’clock in the afternoon
the thousand circulars were all folded, and the
thousand envelopes all addressed and stamped.</p>

<p>“Why, hello, my young friends,” hailed the village
postmaster cheerily, as this big mail was deposited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
on the stamp table. “If you keep this up,
you’ll soon have this promoted to a second-class
post office.”</p>

<p>Frank wound up the day’s labor by polishing up
the show case Darry Haven had sent around that
afternoon. They fitted up its glass shelves with
samples of the goods they advertised. They got a
staunch iron standard to support the case, and
screwed this securely to the walk just at the edge of
the street.</p>

<p>“We’ll work to-morrow morning on our catalogue
and the advertising Darry Haven is going to
place for us,” said Frank, as they left for home that
evening.</p>

<p>“Don’t go in too deep at first, Frank,” suggested
Markham.</p>

<p>“No, I have formulated a definite system,” declared
Frank, “and I shall try to stick to it. You
see, I left Greenville with about two hundred dollars.
It has taken about fifty of that to get mother
settled here, and incidental expenses. Then I have
your twenty-five dollars you insist on leaving in
trust with me. I have put fifty dollars aside for
preliminary printing and some advertising in county
papers Darry is going to get cheap for me. If
returns are favorable I shall print a small catalogue,
and put just half of our profits back into circularizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and advertising as fast as the money comes
in.”</p>

<p>They had barely settled down to work the next
morning when two schoolboys put in an appearance.
One wanted to buy a “Twelve Tools in One”
specialty as marked in the show case at twenty-five
cents. The other produced a dime for a set of the
false teeth.</p>

<p>“Profits fifteen cents and a-half to date,” cried
Markham gaily, as their first customers departed.
“Those little fellows will spread our fame.”</p>

<p>“When we get into full running order this local
trade will be a nuisance to us,” declared Markham
towards noon.</p>

<p>In fact, he was kept on the jump attending to
local customers all the morning. A raw young
farmer had come in to blushingly buy a friendship
ring. Several curious townspeople strolled to the
office door, and out of good nature invested in
various knickknacks displayed. One boy bought a
false moustache, and within an hour twenty others
visited the place clamoring for duplicates.</p>

<p>“About to-morrow the answers to our circulars
will begin to come in,” observed Markham.
“That will be the real test of the merit of this
business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“We will close up for the afternoon,” said
Frank. “There’s a lot of little things to do about
the house and lot mother has rented. I promised
she should have our help for half a day.”</p>

<p>After dinner Frank and Markham put on some
old clothes and set briskly at work. They mended
the back stoop of the cottage, propped up a fence,
raked the yard and got the wood shed in order.</p>

<p>About four o’clock both started in at the cistern
at the side of the house. Its top had settled in,
and new boards were required here and there, and a
new trough from the house eaves.</p>

<p>Markham was holding a board that Frank was
nailing, when some one passing by on the street
whistling caused both to look up.</p>

<p>“Don’t let go&mdash;the board will spring loose,”
warned Frank, turning quickly as the pressure from
the board end was suddenly removed&mdash;“why,
Markham&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, the mischief!” muttered Markham.</p>

<p>In wonderment and consternation at a swift
glance Frank noticed a strangely startled expression
on his companion’s face.</p>

<p>Then, his eyes fixed steadfastly upon the street,
Markham deliberately jumped down into the cistern
out of sight.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>A NEST EGG</small></h2>


<p>“Quick, grab the pole!” shouted Frank.</p>

<p>As he spoke he thrust a long scantling down into
the cistern.</p>

<p>“Reach for my hand&mdash;grab it. You’ll be
drowned,” continued Frank.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother&mdash;I’m all safe,” came up Markham’s
hollow tones. “There’s only about three
feet of water here.”</p>

<p>“How did you ever come to slip in?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“Say,” spoke Markham, not replying to the direct
inquiry, “while I’m in here I may as well see
if everything is sound and straight with the cistern.”</p>

<p>Frank saw him flare a match. Some curious
thoughts were running through Frank’s mind as to
the strange actions of his companion and helper.</p>

<p>Before he could analyze them, however, Frank
saw Bob Haven turn in at the gate. He had a
package under his arm. Bob stood still for a moment
to gaze after the person who had just preceded
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>This latter was a young man, dressed loudly in
brand new clothes, waving a slender cane with a
dandified air, his whole bearing suggesting a person
trying to look important and attract attention.
This was the fellow the sight of whom had apparently
induced Markham to plunge out of sight into
the cistern.</p>

<p>Bob Haven stared hard after the receding figure
of the stranger.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” he was saying as he approached
Frank.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Bob?” inquired Frank.</p>

<p>“Did you see that fellow just passed by?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do you know him?”</p>

<p>“I did once&mdash;thoroughly. Heard he was in
town. The nerve, now!”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“He’s bad all through. Name is Dale Wacker.
When Bart Stirling first took his father’s place
as express agent here, that fellow’s uncle plotted
to down him. Worse than that, he stole a lot of
stuff from the express people. The police were
after him. Dale, his nephew, was mixed up in it,
and had to leave town. Heard he was in jail
somewhere for some new exploits. Came back
yesterday, I learned. Seemed to have plenty of
money and tried to cut a figure showing it. Says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
he’s a travelling man now, and earning untold
wealth. Guess he’s on the way to the depot now,
to find new victims to swindle where he isn’t so
well known as he is here. I say, who’s in there,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>As Bob spoke, Markham came climbing up the
scantling out of the cistern. He was wet to the
knees and looked troubled of face.</p>

<p>Frank noticed that he glanced anxiously in the
direction of the street.</p>

<p>“Better go and get on dry clothes,” suggested
Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh, this job won’t take us long to finish, now,”
answered Markham.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got some printing to deliver,” said
Bob. “Come over to the house after supper, fellows.”</p>

<p>“All right,” acquiesced Frank, but Markham
said nothing. He acted subdued and worried until
the cistern was finished. He stuck closely to the
house after the work was done, and made some
excuse for not going over to visit Bob and Darry
after supper.</p>

<p>Frank was slightly disturbed at these actions&mdash;secretly
he feared that a sight of the fellow Bob
had called Dale Wacker had caused Markham to
get out of sight. Frank wished he knew why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank found his mother and Markham both
reading when he came home, about nine o’clock.
He kept his eye on the latter as he remarked to his
mother that Darry had read to him a little news
item he had gathered in for the <i>Herald</i> late that
afternoon.</p>

<p>It was about a fellow named Dale Wacker,
Frank narrated. It seemed he was on his way to
the railroad depot, when an old German peddler
to whom he had owed money for over two years
recognized and hailed him.</p>

<p>The peddler gave Wacker a great scoring and
demanded his money. A crowd gathered, and
Wacker started on his way at a fast walk. The
peddler whipped up his horse to keep pace with
him, whilst administering a continuous tongue-lashing.</p>

<p>The sorry nag did not keep up with the procession
as Wacker broke into a run. Seizing a basket
of eggs, the peddler jumped down from the
wagon. He was a big, fat, unwieldly person, but
he pursued the fugitive vigorously.</p>

<p>The crowd hooted and yelled as the German began
to pelt the eggs after the fugitive. Two eggs
struck Wacker in the middle of the back. One
shied off his hat and broke on the back of his head.
Bespattered and hatless, the fellow reached the depot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
just in time to grab the platform rail of the
last car on a departing train.</p>

<p>“Oh, got out of town, did he?” asked Markham
quite eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, it seems so&mdash;faster than he had calculated
on,” responded Frank.</p>

<p>“Won’t be likely to come back again after that
reception, eh?” said Markham.</p>

<p>“I should think not. He’ll be afraid of something
worse.”</p>

<p>Markham brightened up. He acted like a different
person at once. He laughed, told some
funny stories, was his natural self once more, and
Frank was very glad of it.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow,” he mused. “He’s got some
harrowing secret on his mind, that’s sure, and he
doesn’t want to meet certain people for some reason
or other, and this Dale Wacker is one of them.
Well, he’s been true blue to me, and I won’t worry
him by asking about this mystery. It will come out
some time, and if he’s in danger of trouble I’ll
stick to him like a brother, for I know he hasn’t
got a grain of real badness in his nature.”</p>

<p>With the morning all of Markham’s recent disquietude
seemed to have entirely disappeared.
When they got down to the office he kept a close
watch until nine o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mail’s in, Frank,” he announced at last, putting
on his cap.</p>

<p>“All right,” nodded Frank, keeping on with his
writing.</p>

<p>“Fatal hour approaches. We shall soon know
our doom,” continued Markham in a mock-alarm
way.</p>

<p>He picked up a new canvas mail satchel marked
“F. M. O. H.,” and started for the door.</p>

<p>“See here,” hailed Frank, “don’t you think
you can about carry all of our first morning’s mail
in some modest pocket?”</p>

<p>“Don’t care if I can. Big mail satchel makes
a good business impression, see?” and Markham
darted off, wondering if Frank’s heart was beating
as fast as his own over the suspense attached to
their first mail results.</p>

<p>Frank was indeed anxious, but he tried to go on
with his writing. All the same his nerves were on
keen edge and his hand was a trifle unsteady, as
Markham returned from the post office and placed
the satchel on the desk before him.</p>

<p>“Eight letters,” said Frank, drawing out the
mail in the satchel. “That isn’t so bad. Well,
let us see what our correspondents have to say.”</p>

<p>Frank cut open the end of the first missive, and
Markham watched him like a ferret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“No money in this one,” reported Frank, the
enclosure in hand. “Well, well, listen to this
now! ‘You are a frod. I bot an apple corer
last munth, and it was no good. You out to
be persecuted.’”</p>

<p>Frank was quite disappointed, and Markham
gulped several times as each succeeding letter produced
no money or stamps. Two people asked for
a catalogue. One correspondent wanted a “Twelve
Tools in One” sent to him, and if found satisfactory
would remit forthwith.</p>

<p>Another correspondent sent an order for a ring,
and wanted it “charged.” Then there was a man
who asked if they could furnish him with a cheap
second-hand thrasher for his farm.</p>

<p>One client wrote that if they would send him
samples of their entire list, he would show the
goods in his town and possibly get them lots of
customers.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Frank, feeling of the last letter,
“here is something tangible, sure, Markham. I
can feel the coin.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a cent,” suggested Markham, with
a slight tinge of sarcasm.</p>

<p>“No, a ten-cent piece, sure enough,” declared
Frank. “For your puzzle, Markham, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” put in Markham, picking up the coin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that Frank had placed on his desk, “but the dime
is&mdash;lead!”</p>

<p>Frank pulled a dismal face. Markham looked
actually mad. Then their glances met. They
broke into a hearty laugh mutually.</p>

<p>“Humph!” commented Markham.</p>

<p>“Amusing, isn’t it?” asked Frank, trying hard
to keep up his courage.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, there’s the afternoon mail,” suggested
Markham, getting up and beginning to fold
some more circulars. “Who expected any mail of
consequence this morning, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Frank resumed his task of working on the catalogue.
He whistled a cheery bar or two, felt too
serious to keep it up, and went on with his work in
a half-hearted way.</p>

<p>“This Frank’s Mail Order House?” demanded
a brisk voice, half an hour later.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know it is?” challenged Frank,
arising to welcome Ned Davis, a bright young fellow,
who was the messenger of the local bank.</p>

<p>“All right,” chirped Ned. “Got a letter this
morning from a correspondent at Bayview. Enclosure.
Man running a small store there asks us
if Frank’s Mail Order House is a reliable concern.
If so, instructs us to place this order with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned importantly spread out quite a voluminous
order list before Frank.</p>

<p>“Accompanied with the cash,” added Ned, and
set down a crisp, encouraging-looking five-dollar
bill beside the document.</p>

<p>“Oh!” ejaculated Markham, almost falling off
his chair with surprise.</p>

<p>“Ned,” said Frank, with a touch of genuine
feeling, “thank you.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” responded Ned. “We’re
simply working to get your bank account when it
runs up into the thousands, see?”</p>

<p>“Will it ever, I wonder?” murmured Frank.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a nest egg?” challenged the practical
young financier.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>A SUSPICIOUS VISITOR</small></h2>


<p>Frank looked up from his work with an eager
flush on his face. Markham, who had gone to the
post office, was returning. His light, springy step
coming up the walk, and cheery, ringing whistle
told Frank that he was the bearer of good news.</p>

<p>“Afternoon mail,” sang out Markham, putting
the satchel down on Frank’s desk. “And she’s a
cracker-jack!”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Over thirty letters,” continued Markham
gaily. “Stamps in some, coin in others. My finger
tips just itched to feel those letters, Frank. I
just had to do it. Oh, if this suspense keeps up
I’ll be rifling the mails next.”</p>

<p>Frank slitted all the letters in turn. Four postal
cards asking for catalogues were promptly disposed
of. The first of the letters was from a
country newspaper offering reduced terms for advertising.</p>

<p>There was an application for an agency. No.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
3 wanted to be hired in the office&mdash;could count
money and put on postage stamps fast.</p>

<p>Frank was not given to being very demonstrative
on any occasion. As, however, he now began
to stare at the next letter he opened and almost
uttered a shout, Markham knew that something
very much out of the ordinary had come up.</p>

<p>“What is it, Frank?” he questioned eagerly.</p>

<p>“Markham,” said Frank, quite unnerved with
excitement, “it’s a big, big order.”</p>

<p>“How big?” demanded Markham. “Quick,
I’m on the edge of nervous prostration.”</p>

<p>“Fifty to one hundred dollars,” announced
Frank, in quite a husky voice. “A few more of
such orders and we’ll know where we stand. It’s
from the owner of a general store at Decatur.
He writes that he has purchased from an advertising
agency fifty-two picture rebuses&mdash;easy ones&mdash;one
for each week in the year. Accompanying
them are fifty-two separate advertisements. These
he intends to insert in his weekly paper. He
wants to offer each week ten prizes for the ten persons
who first appear at his store with correct solutions
of the rebuses.”</p>

<p>“I see,” nodded Markham&mdash;“good idea.”</p>

<p>“He wants us to designate fifty-two novelties
that we can supply, about half and half ten-and-twenty-cent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
articles. He will take ten of each
article, or five hundred and twenty in all. Think
of it, Markham!”</p>

<p>“It’s grand, yes, just grand!” declared Markham,
in a tone of suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>“He says he will trust to our judgment to select
the most catchy novelties, only he expects us
to give him special figures on the lot.”</p>

<p>“Of course you’ll do it, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and make a neat profit, too. Well, this
is encouraging.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Frank, that one order will cover the cost
of all the circularizing we have done to date.
Hello! hello! hello!”</p>

<p>In three different crescendo tones Markham tallied
off three letters which Frank opened next in
turn, and in each instance with cash results&mdash;two
silver dimes and thirty cents in postage stamps.</p>

<p>When the entire mail was opened, Frank had a
little heap at his elbow representing six dollars and
eighty cents, three dollars of which was to pay for
two rings.</p>

<p>“Seven orders for your puzzle, Markham,” announced
Frank, “besides what goes in the big order.
Only one apple corer ordered. I’m afraid
my prized invention is a frost.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” dissented Markham. “Look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
here, it’s plain from the letter you got this morning
that the Riverton hardware man had already
used at least some of the names in the mail order
lists. If I were you, Frank, in any new printed
matter you get out I would refer to your apple
corer as a decided improvement on the old one. I
think, even, I would illustrate these improvements.”</p>

<p>“An excellent idea, Markham,” declared Frank.
“Further, I don’t know but it would be a good
thing to offer one of the new corers, free on return
of an old one, charging only the postage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re learning,” declared Markham,
buoyantly. “This thing is a decided go.”</p>

<p>Frank was immersed in business during the rest
of that week. Markham proved an energetic and
reliable assistant. There were circulars to send
out, orders to fill, letters to write.</p>

<p>Saturday night they had to work till eleven
o’clock to clean up their desks. Frank was rushing
the catalogue copy. Mrs. Haven was busy
making new drawings, which had to be sent to the
city to be photo-engraved. Orders, too, were sent
daily to the city supply houses.</p>

<p>Up at the novelty factory they were filling
Frank’s first big order for a thousand of the wire
puzzles and a thousand of the new apple corers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>This latter device was really a very meritorious
article. Retaining the form and dimensions of
the original sheath, Frank had set inside two moving
pieces of tin that acted as knives. These ran
into a spiral tube which penetrated the apple without
injuring it, and a twist on a knob cut the core
out clean as a whistle.</p>

<p>Monday morning’s mail was the largest yet received,
due, Frank believed, to some little advertising
Haven Bros. had caused to be inserted in a few
neighboring country newspapers.</p>

<p>His little capital was now again nearly at the
two hundred dollar mark. About noon Frank
made up a package of about two hundred dollars.
He had arranged to pay this amount to
Haven Bros., draw against it if he ran short of
funds, otherwise leave it in their hands to pay for
the catalogue, which would be quite an expensive
job.</p>

<p>Markham had gone to the post-office with some
mail. Frank looked up as a footstep sounded on
the walk outside of the office door.</p>

<p>It was not Markham, as Frank at first expected.
Instead, a person he regarded in a decidedly unfavorable
light came into view.</p>

<p>The visitor was Dale Wacker, the boy Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Haven had designated to Frank the day that
Markham made his sensational dive into the cistern.</p>

<p>He was not dressed as jauntily as on that occasion.
His appearance was shabby and unkempt
now. He slouched up to the door with a sneak-thief
air, yet withal the brass and effrontery of a
person possessed of few fine sensibilities.</p>

<p>“Say,” spoke Wacker to Frank, “you run this
shop?”</p>

<p>“I’m interested in this business, yes,” answered
Frank distantly.</p>

<p>“Pretty good graft? Looking for some such
fake myself. What I wanted to know, though,
was about one of your samples in the show case
out there.”</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p>“That wire puzzle.”</p>

<p>“What about it?”</p>

<p>“Where did you run across it?”</p>

<p>Frank did not like the speech nor manner of his
visitor.</p>

<p>“Is that particularly any of your business?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Why, you see, just curious about it, that’s all,”
stammered Wacker, somewhat taken aback at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Frank’s sharp challenge. “Do you own it?”</p>

<p>Frank’s eye flashed with manifest resentment at
Wacker’s cool effrontery.</p>

<p>“See here,” he said pretty firmly, “I have no
time to waste answering idle and impertinent questions,”
and turned away from the door.</p>

<p>“Well, I’d seen it before, that’s all,” muttered
Wacker.</p>

<p>“Oh, I fancy not,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I did. Huh! guess I did&mdash;I was
with the fellow who first made it when he got
it up.”</p>

<p>Frank was surprised. He must have shown it
to the keen-eyed fellow quizzing him, for Wacker
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Aha&mdash;interested now, hain’t you? Tell you
something more: the owner made me a duplicate
of his original puzzle, and&mdash;there it is.”</p>

<p>And to Frank’s amazement Mr. Dale Wacker
pulled from his pocket a crude copy of the wire
puzzle.</p>

<p>It was the exact counterpart of the one Markham
had furnished as a model for those now being
sold broadcast by Frank’s Mail Order House.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>MISSING</small></h2>


<p>Frank was a good deal upset. In the light of
the cistern episode and the knowledge that Markham
seemed afraid to meet certain people, he believed
that the advent of his present visitor boded
no good for his friend and helper.</p>

<p>As Dale Wacker showed the wire puzzle, stating
that he knew its inventor, Frank felt that he
was in the presence of a mystery.</p>

<p>“Let me look at that, will you?” he said.</p>

<p>“Sure,” grinned Wacker. “Why not? Take
a good look, too. Seems familiar? Quite the
right thing, eh?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p>“Why, just this,” retorted Wacker: “How
do you come to be selling an article that no one
has a right to sell except my friend who made it?
I happen to know he invented that puzzle. I was
with him when he did.”</p>

<p>“When was that?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh, about six months ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“And where?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re asking questions, hey?” said
Wacker, with a cunning air. “You tell me first:
do you know the fellow who made that puzzle?”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Dick Welmore.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of him.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” cried Dale Wacker triumphantly,
“then I’ve got you. I say, young fellow, you’re
violating the law, you are. See here, I’m hard
up. I know where Dick Welmore is snug and
tight. If you don’t make it worth my while, I’ll
go to him and have you prosecuted for stealing his
invention.”</p>

<p>“Get out of here,” cried Frank, with flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>“Hold on, now. Say, give me a job, and I’ll
keep mum. Say, I can write a good hand. Once
I took stock, see&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I reckon you’ve taken stock to your cost,
if what I hear is true. March out, and it won’t
be healthy for you to come around here again.”</p>

<p>“I can make you trouble.”</p>

<p>“Try it.”</p>

<p>Frank gave Wacker a decided push through the
open doorway. Wacker was muttering under his
breath all kinds of dire threats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>At exactly that moment Frank looked along the
walk to the street at the echo of a cherry whistle.
It was instantly checked. Markham, tripping towards
the office, halted with a shock. Like a
flash he turned at a sight of Wacker. He disappeared
so quickly that Frank wondered if Wacker
got a clear look at him.</p>

<p>The latter, with a malignant growl at Frank,
went away without another word. In some perplexity
Frank sat down at his desk, thinking hard
and fast.</p>

<p>“I just couldn’t truckle with that fellow,” he
said. “Dick Welmore, eh? Can that be Markham’s
real name? Evidently, though, this
Wacker doesn’t know Markham is here. He
thinks he is somewhere else, ‘snug and tight.’
Oh, bother! there’s only one right course to take in
such a case, and I’ll follow it.”</p>

<p>Frank decided that at quitting time he would
lock himself and Markham into the office, and ask
for an explanation of his fear and dread of meeting
Dale Wacker.</p>

<p>“It won’t be to Markham’s discredit, I’ll guarantee,”
reflected Frank. “He’s square, if there
ever was a square boy. Here he is now.”</p>

<p>Markham appeared, breathing hard and looking
excited. He tried, however, to appear calm. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
face was quite pale. Frank saw that he was under
an intense nervous strain.</p>

<p>“Oh, Markham,” said Frank, not indicating
that he noticed his friend’s perturbation, “I want
you to take that money to Darry Haven.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Markham, glancing over
his shoulder towards the street.</p>

<p>“Be careful of it, won’t you now?” directed
Frank, with a little laugh. “Remember, it’s our
entire capital, and here’s the mailing lists. Tell
Darry to get them set up and printed just as quick
as he can. We need them at once.”</p>

<p>Frank had decided to have the mailing list
names printed, each on a separate line with a broad
margin. This he did so they could keep a permanent
record of the result of using each name. Besides
that, in the fire at Riverton the lists had got
charred, and some of them were brittle and broken
away, and some pages hard to decipher.</p>

<p>Markham clasped the wallet containing the
money tightly in one hand, thrust it into his outside
coat pocket, and tucked the rolled-up lists
under his arm.</p>

<p>“Be back soon,” he said.</p>

<p>“All right, do so. Want to have a little talk
with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Markham looked up quickly, hesitated, gave a
sigh, and started rapidly down the walk.</p>

<p>“I’ll have it over and done with, soon as he
comes back,” reflected Frank. “Poor fellow.
Something’s on his mind. I’m going to help him
get rid of it.”</p>

<p>Frank resumed his task. He was soon engrossed
in finishing up a page of writing.</p>

<p>“Good,” he said finally, with satisfaction, “the
last copy for the catalogue. It will make twenty-four
printed pages. The cuts I have had made
and the cuts the supply houses have loaned me
make a very fine showing. Well, the first two
weeks show up pretty good. Business started, and
paying expenses. Why, that’s queer,” exclaimed
Frank with a start, as he chanced to glance at the
clock&mdash;“Markham has been gone a full half-hour.”</p>

<p>It was queer. Markham had less than three
squares to go on his errand. Usually he made
the trip to Haven Bros. in five minutes.</p>

<p>Frank walked to the door and looked out. He
stood there, growing restless and anxious, as ten
minutes went by. Then he grew restless, put on
his cap, waited five minutes longer, and, closing the
office door, went out to the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pshaw,” he said, looking up and down the
street, “what am I worrying about? Got that
Dale Wacker on my mind, and it has upset me.
Markham is probably chatting with Bob Haven.
Well, I’ve gone so far, I’ll step over to the printing
office and see.”</p>

<p>Frank walked rapidly to the principal street, and
up the flight of stairs in a business block to Haven
Bros.’s office.</p>

<p>As he entered he noticed all hands busy at cases
and presses. Bob, shirt sleeves rolled up, was
working on some chases on an imposing stone.
Darry was reading proof at his desk.</p>

<p>But there was no Markham. Frank experienced
a sensation of dread for which he could not account.
He tried to keep cool, but the first word
he spoke as he approached Darry made the latter
look up quickly.</p>

<p>“Got the money I sent you, Darry?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“Why, no&mdash;did you send it?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;over half-an-hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Who by?”</p>

<p>“Markham.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then, he’s doing some other errand first,”
said Darry. “Sit down, if you’re going to wait
for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I’ll watch them doing things,” answered
Frank, with an assumed lightness of tone.</p>

<p>He strolled about the neat little office, pretending
to be interested. It was a dead failure. A
lump of lead seemed bearing him down. Frank
glanced at his watch. An hour had passed since
he had sent Markham on his errand.</p>

<p>“Be back soon, Darry,” he said, and went out
of the printing office with a dull, sick feeling at
heart.</p>

<p>Frank returned to his office. Markham was not
there. He went back to the print shop.</p>

<p>“Markham been here yet?” he inquired in a
failing voice to Darry.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Then something’s wrong,” suddenly burst out
Frank, unable longer to endure the strain of suspense
and dread.</p>

<p>“Why, how pale you are,” began Darry, rising
from his chair.</p>

<p>“Yes, Darry,” said Frank in a quivering tone&mdash;“Markham
is missing, and with him my mailing
lists and over two hundred dollars in cash.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>A BAD BUSINESS</small></h2>


<p>Frank came down to the office the next morning
looking haggard and troubled. Stet was hanging
around the door.</p>

<p>“Darry Haven told me to wait till you came
down, and then let him know,” said the little fellow.</p>

<p>“All right,” nodded Frank in a dull way.</p>

<p>Stet darted off with his usual elfish nimbleness.
Frank unlocked the door and sat down before his
desk rather gloomily. He mechanically arranged
some papers. Darry was with him before he had
accomplished much. Stet accompanied him.</p>

<p>“Well, Frank,” questioned Darry, “any word
of Markham?”</p>

<p>“Not a trace, Darry.”</p>

<p>“Strange, isn’t it?” observed Darry in a musing
way. “I declare I can’t understand it.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Frank. “It’s him I’m thinking
of, not of myself. I haven’t slept a wink all night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Honest, Darry, if he was an own brother I couldn’t
feel more anxious. Mother is quite as worried.
I went everywhere about town last evening till the
stores shut up. I telephoned several neighboring
towns. I saw trainmen around the depot.”</p>

<p>“And found no one who had seen Markham
after you sent him on that errand with the money
and the mailing lists?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul, Darry.”</p>

<p>“How do you explain it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t. I suppose some people who don’t
know Markham as I do, would say I was a fool to
take up a stranger and put so much trust in him,
that it served me right to have him run away with
all I have in the world first chance he got. Well,
let me tell you, Darry, that boy wouldn’t do me a
wrong turn wilfully for a million dollars, and I
know it.”</p>

<p>Darry sighed and was silent. He had liked
Markham, but his young business career had
brought him in contact with so many weak and absolutely
bad people, that secretly he feared that
Markham had yielded to temptation, and they
would not hear of him again.</p>

<p>“Have you no theory as to the reason why
Markham should be missing so mysteriously?” he
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, yes, I have, in a way, Darry,” responded
Frank, “but it is all guess-work. I told you last
night about some secret in his life.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” nodded Darry.</p>

<p>“I also told you that I was convinced that Dale
Wacker knew Markham, and that Markham for
some reason dreaded meeting him.”</p>

<p>“It certainly looked that way, judging from
Markham’s actions.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I think they ran into each other
after Markham went on the errand to you.
Wacker is a blackmailer, as his talk to me about
the puzzle plainly shows. Does he know something
about Markham that might make him trouble?
It certainly looks that way. He may have
terrorized Markham into running away.”</p>

<p>“All right, if that is true, then Markham, if he
is an honest boy, will send back your money and the
mailing lists.”</p>

<p>“Of course he will,” declared Frank. “I’ve
been expecting to receive them every hour.”</p>

<p>“And if he doesn’t,” suggested Darry, somewhat
skeptically.</p>

<p>“If he doesn’t,” repeated Frank, slowly but
steadily, “then make up your mind to one thing.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?”</p>

<p>“That Markham is in the power of some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
who holds him a prisoner, and can’t get word to
me.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Darry simply. Frank’s eyes
flashed.</p>

<p>“Furthermore,” he went on, “assuming that, I
shall make it my business to investigate along that
line, I shall never lose faith in Markham’s honesty
and fidelity to me till I have used every endeavor
to find out when, where and why he dropped out of
sight so mysteriously.”</p>

<p>“You’re a staunch friend, you are,” commented
Darry. “In the meantime, though, Frank, your
capital is gone. Worse than that, the whole basis
of your business has gone with it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the mailing lists,” said Frank. “I’ve
thought that all out, Darry. You will have to
stop work on the catalogue and the rest of the
printing. I can’t pay for the work.”</p>

<p>“We’ll trust you.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Frank steadily, “I can’t run into
debt.”</p>

<p>“We might spare a little cash till&mdash;till you
hear from the other.”</p>

<p>“I won’t involve my friends. I have planned
it all out. My mother is coming down to the office
to take care of the little business that will come
in from the advertising.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what will you do?” asked Darry curiously.</p>

<p>“I have arranged to hire a horse and wagon. I
shall go out and visit small towns and sell from
door to door, or even from the wagon, till I hear
from that missing money, or get on my feet
again.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good one,” pronounced Darry with
an admiring sparkle in his eye, slapping Frank
heartily on the shoulder. “You’re a stubborn
one, too, so I won’t intrude offers of assistance only
to be turned down.”</p>

<p>“All the time,” resumed Frank, “I shall be
looking out for a trace of Markham. See here,
Darry, I can’t get that Dale Wacker off my mind.
Who are his companions? Where does he hang
out? How am I going to set a watch on him?”</p>

<p>“He may not even be in town,” suggested
Darry. “You know Bob and I went all over
Pleasantville last evening, like yourself seeking a
trace of Markham. It looked as if Wacker had
flashed into town and out again. We didn’t run
across him, and we didn’t find anybody who had
seen him since late in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Say, can I speak a word?” piped in an anxious
voice.</p>

<p>It was little Stet who had spoken. Frank and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Darry had forgotten all about him. Now Stet got
up timorously from the door step.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you,” said Darry. “Heard all we’ve
said, too, I suppose, Stet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have,” replied Stet. “Had to&mdash;ought
to&mdash;I’m interested, I am. I like you. I
like Mr. Newton. You’re both my friends. I
like Markham, too. He gave Hemp Carson, the
<i>Eagle</i> manager, a setting down for pitching onto
me. I don’t like Dale Wacker. Huh! hadn’t
ought to. He robbed me of two dollars once.
Well, Dale Wacker is in Pleasantville. I saw him
this morning. He came in on a farmer’s wagon
from somewhere out of town.”</p>

<p>“That’s news, anyway,” said Darry.</p>

<p>“You were going to give me my regular ten
days’ vacation next week, you know,” continued
Stet to Darry. “Make it begin to-day, and I’ll
soon find out for you all there is to find out about
Dale Wacker’s doings.”</p>

<p>“But that is hardly a vacation, Stet?” suggested
Frank.</p>

<p>“It will be,” chuckled the little fellow, “if I
can get my two dollars’ worth of satisfaction out of
him by showing him up.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Darry, “try it, Stet, if you
want to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Stet went away forthwith. Frank went into details
with Darry as to the mail order business. It
must remain partially inactive until something encouraging
developed.</p>

<p>The morning mail was a pretty good one.
About ten o’clock Mrs. Ismond came down to the
office, and Frank initiated his mother into the business
routine.</p>

<p>“Just get the mail each day, and fill what orders
you can,” said Frank. “When you can’t fill an
order, return the money. You see, mother, I want
to take the bulk of stock on hand with me for quick
sales, and I can’t order any more until I get some
money ahead.”</p>

<p>Frank put in two hours about town trying to
look up Markham. The result was quite as discouraging
as upon the day previous. He closed
an arrangement for the hire of a horse and a light
wagon, and packed up some goods at the office,
ready for his trip into the country.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ismond, with a woman’s instinctive capacity
for neatness, had the office in attractive order
by late afternoon, and all the work attended to.</p>

<p>“Don’t get discouraged, Frank,” she said, as
they were on their way home. “It won’t take a
great deal of money to keep up the business in a
small way. I sent out a hundred circulars this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
afternoon, and I will keep on at that average while
you are away.”</p>

<p>“Why,” spoke Frank, “how can you do that,
with no mailing list addresses?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I set my wits at work and made quite a
discovery,” responded Mrs. Ismond with a bright
smile. “The Pleasantville <i>Herald</i> has quite a list
of exchanges. I asked Darry to send me some.
They come from all over the State. I selected a
number of promising names from little news items
in the papers. For instance: I took girls’ names
from church and society items, and boys’ names
from baseball club items and the like. Good,
fresh names, Frank&mdash;don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“I do see,” said Frank, “and it’s a grand idea,
mother.”</p>

<p>After supper Mrs. Ismond went upstairs to make
up a little parcel of collars, handkerchiefs and the
like for her son’s journey.</p>

<p>Frank looked up from the county map from
which he was formulating a route, as his mother
reappeared. At a glance he saw that she was very
much agitated.</p>

<p>“Oh, Frank!” she panted, sinking into a chair
pale and distressed-looking.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter, mother?” exclaimed
Frank, arising quickly to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ismond had a worn yellow sheet of paper
in her hand.</p>

<p>“Markham,” she said, in a sad, pained way.
“I was getting out some neckties for you, and by
mistake opened the bureau drawer where he kept
his belongings. I found this.”</p>

<p>“What is it, mother?” asked Frank, taking the
paper from her hand. He saw for himself, and
his face turned quite as white and troubled as her
own.</p>

<p>“Too bad&mdash;too bad,” said Frank, looking
down at the time-worn sheet of paper in a disheartened
way.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>AN UNEXPECTED MEETING</small></h2>


<p>It was a depressing discovery that Mrs. Ismond
had made. Frank sat staring at the paper in his
hand in silence for some minutes.</p>

<p>This was a printed sheet. It was headed:
“Reward&mdash;One Hundred Dollars.” In short,
the warden of the Juvenile Reformatory at Linwood,
offered that amount for the return to that
institution of an escaped inmate&mdash;Richard Markham
Welmore.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is our Markham,” murmured Frank&mdash;“that
is his middle name. The description answers
him exactly,” and again Frank said in a
troubled way: “Too bad&mdash;too bad.”</p>

<p>Frank knew what his mother was thinking of&mdash;that
they had harbored a convicted criminal, who
had weakly yielded to temptation, beggaring them,
and going back to his old evil ways.</p>

<p>He now knew what Dale Wacker meant when
he spoke of the inventor of the wire puzzle as being
in a “snug, tight place.” Markham had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
sought relief from his irksome confinement getting
up the pleasant little novelty that had taken so
well. Evidently Wacker, when he first called on
Frank, was not aware of the fact that Markham
had escaped.</p>

<p>Wacker had probably once himself been an inmate
of the reformatory. He knew its rules and
routine. Coming across Markham on his way to
Haven Bros., what more natural, Frank reasoned,
than that he should take advantage of this knowledge?
His recognition by Wacker would crush
Markham. Had Wacker terrified him so that he
had led him to some quiet spot, bargained with
him, robbed him, sent him back to the reformatory,
and laid claim to the reward?</p>

<p>“I am going to find out,” cried Frank, starting
for his cap, but instantly quieting down again as he
reflected farther.</p>

<p>His impulse was to hurry downtown and telegraph
the reformatory at Linwood for information.
Suddenly, however, he reflected that if his
surmises were wrong, and things turned out differently
than he theorized, he would simply be putting
the authorities on the track of the unfortunate
Markham.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said, “nothing will make me believe
that Markham voluntarily stole my money.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
No, this Dale Wacker had a hand in this disappearance.
Perhaps poor Markham met him and
fled, and is in hiding. We may hear from him
yet.”</p>

<p>“But, Frank,” suggested Mrs. Ismond in a
broken tone of voice, “we are sure now that Markham
was a&mdash;a bad boy.”</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“He was the inmate of a reformatory.”</p>

<p>“When I think of the old wasted days in my
own life when I ran away from home,” said Frank,
“and the evil men I met who would have got me
into any kind of trouble to further their own
schemes, and I innocently walking into their trap,
I shall give Markham the benefit of a doubt, every
time. What right have we to assume that he was
not a victim of wrong? No, no! He was a true
friend, an honest worker. I won’t desert or forget
him until I have cleared up all this mystery.”</p>

<p>Frank was up before five o’clock the next morning.
He had just finished cutting a week’s supply
of kindling wood in the wood shed, when Stet
popped into view over the back fence.</p>

<p>Stet tried to look like a real detective. He
glanced back over his shoulder. He even said
“Hist!” in first hailing Frank. Then he asked:</p>

<p>“Going away to-day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve got to, Stet,” answered Frank. “Have
you been looking up that Wacker fellow?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been doing nothing else,” answered Stet,
putting on a serious, careworn look. “Say, he’s
a bad one. Hangs out at the worst places on Railroad
Street, and plays cards all the time.”</p>

<p>“Throwing away his money, eh?”</p>

<p>“He don’t seem to have much. No,” said Stet,
“I saw him borrow from two or three chums.
But he’s got great prospects, I heard him say.
He’s waiting for somebody to come to Pleasantville,
or for something to happen. You leave it to
me. I’ll watch him like a ferret, only you’d better
leave word where I can find you, if anything important
comes up.”</p>

<p>“All right, Stet. My mother will know where
I am each day I am gone.”</p>

<p>“And say,” continued Stet, “I want you to say
something to me.”</p>

<p>“Say something to you, Stet?” repeated Frank
in a puzzled way.</p>

<p>“Uh&mdash;huh.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I want you to look at me fierce, and frown,
and say that you order me out of your place, and
if I show up again you’ll break every bone in my
body.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“See here&mdash;” began Frank in wonderment.</p>

<p>“Now, you just say it,” persisted Stet. “I
know my business,” and he blinked and chuckled
craftily.</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;here goes.”</p>

<p>“Good as a play,” declared Stet, as Frank went
through the rigmarole. “Now I needn’t tell any
lies. Thrown out by my friends, discharged from
my job, O&mdash;O&mdash;Oh!” and Stet affected sobs of
the deepest misery. “Had Bob Haven kicked me&mdash;not
hard&mdash;out of the shop last night. See?
Object of abuse and sympathy. Oh, I’m fixed
now to play Mr. Dale Wacker good and strong.”</p>

<p>Stet disappeared the way he had come in a high
state of elation. Frank went into the house for
breakfast. He walked as far as the office with his
mother. Then he went to the livery stable where
he had hired the turnout.</p>

<p>He was soon on the road. Frank tried to forget
the anxieties of the mail order business and his
missing friend. He planned to cover six little
towns by nightfall.</p>

<p>Frank had good luck from the start. At a
crossroads there was a country schoolhouse, a general
store and some twenty houses. The man running
the store was just stocking in for the fall term
of school. Frank came in the nick of time. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
sold the man over ten dollars worth of notions and
novelties.</p>

<p>Watering his horse at a roadhouse, a little later
on, he interested some loungers on the veranda.
Frank got rid of two rings, a cheap watch, a
pedometer and three of Markham’s puzzles.</p>

<p>At noon he took dinner at Carrollville, quite a
good-sized town. A small circus was playing here.
Frank conceived the idea of buying a privilege to
sell on the circus grounds. The manager wanted
ten dollars for a permit, however, so Frank took up
his stand near the railway depot.</p>

<p>As the crowds came for their trains at five
o’clock, he opened up his novelty stock.</p>

<p>“A pretty thrifty day,” mused Frank, an hour
later, as he started for his final stop of the day at
Gray’s Lake. “Profits eleven dollars and twenty
cents. Why, thirty days of this kind of trade will
give me back my lost capital.”</p>

<p>Gray’s Lake was a settlement and a summer resort.
Frank put up the horse, got a good supper,
and then selected the newest and most salable of
the trinkets and novelties he carried in stock.</p>

<p>Among these was a good assortment of leather
souvenir postal cards, just then a decided novelty
outside of the large cities. He had brought along
a large jewelry tray. This he suspended by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
strap from his neck, and went up to the big hotel
at the end of the lake.</p>

<p>A group of girls in a summer house running out
over the water furnished Frank with his first customers.
He sold two friendship rings and sixteen
postal cards.</p>

<p>A crowd of idle men took fire on the puzzle
proposition, as two men examining the wire devices
got rating one another as to their respective ability
to get the ring off first. A dozen puzzles were
purchased in as many minutes.</p>

<p>Frank went the rounds of the verandas, meeting
with very fair success. The people there had
plenty of money to spare, time hung rather heavy
on their hands, and they welcomed his arrival as
a diversion.</p>

<p>Frank grew to have a decided respect for Markham’s
little puzzle. He had struck the right
crowd to sell it to, this time. At the end of an
hour fully fifty persons could be seen on the well-lighted
verandas and in the hotel rotunda, working
over the clever puzzle. An occasional utterance
of satisfaction would greet the solution of the
puzzle.</p>

<p>“Markham has certainly left me a money-winner,
if he never came back,” reflected Frank.</p>

<p>He was passing along a lighted walk near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
lake beach, when a young lady ran past him towards
a group of friends.</p>

<p>A foppishly-dressed man with a great black
moustache was hastening after her, but she was
calling laughingly back at him:</p>

<p>“No, no, count, you would take all night getting
that ring off&mdash;I’ll try some one else.”</p>

<p>“It ees a meestake. Allow me to try once
more, my dear young lady.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” ejaculated Frank, with a violent
start. Then in a flash he slipped the tray from
place, set it hastily on a vacant bench, and as the
man was passing by him caught him deliberately by
the sleeve.</p>

<p>“Sare!” challenged the man, with a supercilious
stare. “Oh!” he added, wilting down in an instant.</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t know me?” demanded
Frank.</p>

<p>“Nevare, sare.”</p>

<p>“I am Frank Newton, of Greenville, and, for
all your false moustache and broken English, you
are Gideon Purnell.”</p>

<p>“Let go!” hissed the man, with a rapid glance
at the group just beyond them.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Frank firmly, only tightening his
grasp on the man’s coat sleeve. “I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
looking for you for over a year. I knew I should
find you some time. I have found you now.”</p>

<p>“What do you want?” stammered his crestfallen
companion.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes’ quiet conversation with you.”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“You know. You were the tool Mr. Dorsett
used to rob my mother of her fortune. He got
what he was after. You overstepped yourself.
You forged two names in your crooked dealings,
as Mr. Beach, our lawyer at Greenville, has the
proof.”</p>

<p>“Boy,” said Purnell, in a low, quick tone,
“don’t make a rumpus here. Come and see me
to-morrow, and I will do the square thing by you.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do it now,” declared Frank definitely,
“or I will expose you to the people here, and wire
Mr. Beach for instructions.”</p>

<p>“At least let me go and make some excuse to
my friends yonder,” pleaded “the count.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Frank.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>GOOD NEWS</small></h2>


<p>Frank kept a close watch on Purnell. He had
reason to do so. Upon what he might by threats
or persuasion compel this man to divulge, hung all
the future prospects of his mother ever recovering
her stolen fortune.</p>

<p>When Frank’s step-father died, this person, one
of his former associates, had produced notes and
deeds apparently giving him the ownership to
everything that Mr. Ismond owned.</p>

<p>There were many flaws to his claim. Mrs.
Ismond’s lawyer, Mr. Beach, discovered two
arrant forgeries. Before any action at law could
be taken, however, Purnell transferred all the
property to “an innocent purchaser,” Dorsett.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ismond brought suit against the latter, but
even Mr. Beach did not believe the law would
force him to restore what he claimed to have
bought for a valid consideration. Their only
hope seemed to be to find Purnell, who had disappeared.
If through him they could connect Dorsett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
with a conspiracy, Mrs. Ismond would win her
case.</p>

<p>This was the first time since he had fled from
Greenville that Frank had seen this man. Now
he forgot his sample case, Markham, and the
whole mail order business amid the keen importance
of keeping track of the slippery fugitive, and
forcing from him a confession.</p>

<p>Purnell approached the party of young ladies,
still acting the exquisite and playing the foreign
count he pretended to be. He bowed and smirked,
and backed away to Frank.</p>

<p>Instantly his face lost its mask. With a scowl
he dropped his affected foreign drawl.</p>

<p>“You will have it out, here and now, will you?”
he growled, grinding his teeth viciously.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll have it out, or you in,” responded
Frank pointedly.</p>

<p>“Then come to my room.”</p>

<p>The false count led the way into the hotel, hurried
up a staircase, and, unlocking a door on the
second floor, ushered Frank into a room. He lit
the gas and threw himself into a chair, glaring at
Frank in a savage and desperate way.</p>

<p>“You’re a determined young man, you are,” he
observed.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Frank. “It has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the resolve of my life to hunt you down. If you
escape me this time, I shall find you later. You
are masquerading here under false pretences.
I can expose you. Should I telegraph Mr.
Beach, he would at once send an officer to arrest
you.”</p>

<p>“That won’t help your case any,” observed the
man.</p>

<p>“I don’t care. It will prove that Dorsett had
a criminal for a partner, and that will influence the
court when my mother’s suit comes to trial.”</p>

<p>“Name your terms,” spoke Purnell suddenly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Frank gravely: “you helped
rob my mother of the estate her husband left
her. What you got out of it I don’t know, but
it seems to have made it necessary for you to continue
the career of a fugitive and a fraud.”</p>

<p>“What I got!” snapped out Purnell, springing
to his feet in hot anger. “I got what everybody
gets who deals with that old rascal&mdash;the bad end
of the trade, drat him!”</p>

<p>“I’ll leave you alone to your own devices,” said
Frank. “I’ll promise to see that you get some
money when my mother recovers hers, if you will
write out, sign and swear to the facts of your conspiracy
with Dorsett against my mother.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Purnell, after a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of thought. “I’ve got some papers that apply to
the matter. They are in my sitting room. I’ll
get them.”</p>

<p>The speaker walked to a door, turned a key and
disappeared beyond the threshold. Frank sat
awaiting his return. He congratulated himself on
the ease with which he had intimidated the man
to his purposes.</p>

<p>Two minutes passed by, and Frank became impatient,
five, and his suspicions were aroused. He
walked to the door and knocked, tried it, pushed it
open, and found himself, not in a connecting room,
but in a side corridor.</p>

<p>“Well, he has slipped me,” instantly decided
Frank.</p>

<p>He realized that he had been tricked badly.
Frank went to the hotel office to make some inquiries,
made a tour of the grounds, and, finally
surmising that the object of his search had fled for
good, regained his sample tray and returned to the
town.</p>

<p>Frank did not stay all night at the local hotel,
although he went there to ask for mail. He had
given his mother a list of the hotels in the various
towns he expected to visit, secured from a guide
book.</p>

<p>There was a brief note from his mother. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
imparted no particular news, saying only that she
was attending to orders as they came in.</p>

<p>Frank found a cheap lodging, and was back at
the hotel at the lake by six o’clock the next morning.
A brief talk with the clerk convinced him
that Purnell would not be likely to return to that
hostelry.</p>

<p>He had gone, owing a week’s bill, and the two
valises left in his room were found to be filled with
bricks.</p>

<p>“I’ve missed my man this time,” reflected
Frank, as he hitched up the horse an hour later.
“I may as well go right on my route. I’ll find
him again, some time.”</p>

<p>At Derby, Frank upon his arrival went to the
telegraph office. He sent a message to the reformatory
at Linwood, asking if one Richard Welmore
was still an inmate of that institution. He
asked, further, if one Dale Wacker had ever been
a prisoner there.</p>

<p>He went on selling in the town, with fair returns,
until mid-afternoon. A reply to his message
awaited him on his next visit to the telegraph
office. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dale Wacker paroled on bond of his uncle.
Richard Welmore escaped about six months since.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
One hundred dollars reward for his capture. If
know his whereabouts, wire at once.”</p></div>

<p>“That upsets one of my theories,” thought
Frank. “Markham has not been captured for
the reward.”</p>

<p>Brandon was his next town. The day following
he made Essex. He was pretty tired as he
drove to its livery stable, about eight o’clock in
the evening.</p>

<p>After supper he went to the local hotel, and
asked if there was any mail for Frank Newton.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the clerk whom he questioned,
“but here’s a telegram been waiting here for you
since noon.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your trouble,” said Frank,
rather anxiously tearing open the yellow envelope.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” nodded the hotel clerk.
“Good news, I reckon?” he smiled, as Frank’s
face lit up magically at a hasty perusal of the
message.</p>

<p>“I should say so!” declared Frank.</p>

<p>The message was from Darry Haven, at Pleasantville,
and it read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Come home at once. Money found.”</p></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>A RIVAL CONCERN</small></h2>


<p>“I call that extraordinary,” declared Bob
Haven.</p>

<p>“Certainly a sensational and a puzzling piece
of business,” echoed his brother, Darry.</p>

<p>“It is the best news I have had for a long time,”
said Frank, buoyantly. “I tell you, fellows, you
don’t know what a load it has lifted from my
mind.”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” nodded Darry&mdash;“to get
back all that two hundred dollars, when you had
given it up as lost.”</p>

<p>It was ten o’clock in the morning. Frank’s
clothing was covered with dust. His eyes looked
tired and sleepy. Upon the receipt of the telegram
at Essex, he had hitched up the horse
promptly and started for Pleasantville.</p>

<p>Darry welcomed him with effusion, and he and
Bob at once led Frank into their little editorial
sanctum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>There were some quick developments, and now
Frank sat, a queerly decorated sheet of paper in
his hand. On the table before him was the wallet
which had disappeared four days previous with
Markham.</p>

<p>“Tell your story all over again, slowly and carefully,”
said Frank to Darry. “It’s something to
get back that money, but it’s a good deal more to
find out what has become of Markham.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Darry, “it’s just as I told you.
Yesterday noon in our mail we found that letter
you have. As you see, it has an envelope bearing
our name and address printed. We send these out
when we solicit business, and I supposed it was
some new customer asking an estimate on a printing
job. Judge of my surprise, when I found enclosed
that letter.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured Frank, “it’s a queer-looking
affair.”</p>

<p>“You can see how it was put together. It must
have taken hours for its sender to cut all kinds of
letters from a printed newspaper, and slowly and
patiently paste them onto that blank sheet. Letter
by letter he built up those words and sentences.”</p>

<p>Frank once more read over the letter in his
hands, which ran:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“tell frAnk newTon Money is beHind coAl
BoX, thiRd flooR, YoUr buiLDiNg&mdash;mARkHAm.”</p></div>

<p>“Well,” resumed Darry, “Bob and I went up
stairs here at once. None of the offices on the
third floor has been occupied for a long time. In
the hall is a big box with a slanting cover, to hold
fuel for tenants in winter time. Everything was
dirty, and plainly across the dusty box cover it
showed where someone had recently rested, or
been pushed over against the wall. We pulled
out the box. Sure enough, in the four-inch space
behind the box was your money.”</p>

<p>“Then a hot wire, and here you are,” observed
Bob briskly.</p>

<p>“See here, fellows,” said Frank, “I think I can
figure this thing out.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” encouraged Darry.</p>

<p>“Markham sent that letter. He didn’t write,
because he had no pencil. A pencil is usually an
easy thing to get, so he must have been shut up
somewhere. He found in his pocket a sheet of
paper&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way,” here interrupted Darry, “I
forgot to explain something. I recognize the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
sheet of paper as a blank sample I gave Markham,
enclosed in that same envelope, stamped, to give
to Mr. Dawes up at the novelty works when he
went there again. Mr. Dawes asked for a sample
of one linen letter paper. If he wanted a lot, he
was to write the amount on the sheet, and mail to
us.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Frank, “somehow Markham
made paste&mdash;probably out of a piece of
bread. He compiled that letter.”</p>

<p>“But how did he get it mailed?” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>“Suppose he was a prisoner, and threw it from
a window into the road, chancing its discovery and
mailing by some passer-by.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” nodded Darry. “I believe you
are correct in your conclusions, Frank. As to the
mailing lists, which Markham also had with him,
that’s a later mystery to develop.”</p>

<p>“Now then,” spoke Frank, “I think I can also
figure out something else. I believe that Dale
Wacker followed Markham. He was probably
right on his heels when Markham entered this
building. Markham saw him, got scared, and, to
evade him, ran up to the third floor. There he
found no rooms open to hide in. He was cornered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
intimidated, maybe attacked by Wacker.
He thought of that two hundred dollars, and
dropped it behind the fuel box. Then&mdash;”</p>

<p>Frank paused here, and shook his head in doubt
and perplexity.</p>

<p>“Poor Markham,” commented Bob. “It
looks likely that he is held a prisoner somewhere.
Maybe because his captor knows he threw away
that package of money, and won’t let him go free
till he tells where. Anyhow, he’s a good one, surmounting
all the difficulties of his situation and
getting that letter to you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you will take up the mail order
business actively again, now you are in funds?”
suggested Darry.</p>

<p>“Surely,” said Frank. “Here, take the money
and hurry up the catalogue.”</p>

<p>Frank felt immensely relieved as he proceeded to
his office. His mind, however, was full of plans
looking to the discovery of Markham’s place of
captivity.</p>

<p>The letter had been mailed at Hazelhurst, a
mining town about thirty miles distant. Frank
noted this fact, determining to make that town the
starting point of his investigations, as soon as he
got present pressing business in such a shape that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
he might leave the office in charge of his mother
for a day or two.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ismond was very happy over Frank’s return,
and greatly pleased over the recovery of the
missing money. She had quite an encouraging report
to make concerning orders received during
that day and the one preceding.</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way, Frank,” she said, suddenly
recollecting something, “here is a letter addressed
to you marked ‘personal.’ I found it pushed under
the office door this morning.”</p>

<p>“It’s from Stet,” said Frank, glancing at the
enclosure, which interested him very much.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On account of our strained relations,” wrote
Stet, “being ordered from your premises and
kicked out of Haven Bros., I have wormed myself
into the confidence of Dale Wacker. He has
rented a room in the Main Street Block, and
started into the mail order business. An old fellow
is sending out circulars for him, and they have
got a bunch of printed matter from the <i>Eagle</i> Job
Print, and he ordered one thousand watches from
the city last night.”</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>AN UNWELCOME VISITOR</small></h2>


<p>“If Markham were only here!”</p>

<p>Frank Newton said this, with a sigh in a fervent
way. His mother had some household duties to
attend to, and had asked to be spared from the
office for the rest of that afternoon. Frank had
accompanied her as far as the neat, convenient cottage
they now claimed as home.</p>

<p>“Yes, Frank,” she said, in quite a sad tone, “it
is a pity he is not here to share our good fortune,
just as he did your first hard efforts to establish
business.”</p>

<p>“That business is certainly a winner now,” said
Frank. “Mother, I feel it my duty to take a day
off, or even two, if necessary.”</p>

<p>“To look for a trace of Markham?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That would be only right, Frank.”</p>

<p>“It shall be to-morrow,” said Frank. “Good-bye
till supper time.”</p>

<p>Frank walked slowly back to the office reviewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the immediate past of the mail order business,
and speculating as to the demands and prospects
of the future.</p>

<p>“Sense and system” had worked wonders in the
past few days. With the recovery of the missing
money Frank had been enabled to take up his old
plans afresh.</p>

<p>The catalogues were rushed to a finish. He
paid up all the small accumulated bills, and ordered
fresh supplies from the city. He put himself
in touch with attractive novelty markets, and
there was scarcely a mail that did not bring a proposal
to have him advertise and sell some catchy
mail order specialty.</p>

<p>Haven Brothers increased their advertising for
him. Then Frank had conceived a clever follow-up
system for both prospective and old customers.
He took care to sell just what he had
advertised, and there were no complaints.</p>

<p>The wire puzzle was still the leading seller of
his list, but the apple-corer, strengthened by the
special notices Markham had suggested, was beginning
to take hold, too.</p>

<p>Things looked very fair and prosperous for
Frank that afternoon. The only depressing feature
was the continued absence of Markham and
the mystery surrounding it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank had hurried up to get the day off he now
promised himself. There had been so much to
do. Even now he was due in the city to talk over
a proposition with a big manufacturer there. This
gentleman offered to furnish Frank free an eight-page
illustrated insert for his catalogue and special
buying terms, if he would push the goods actively.</p>

<p>The loss of the mailing lists had been severely
felt at first. Mrs. Ismond’s bright wits, however,
had quite solved that difficulty. She continued to
send out circulars from the country papers that
were exchanges on the Pleasantville <i>Herald</i> list.</p>

<p>“The business is growing fast,” reflected
Frank. “Those who buy once, very often write
for some article I haven’t got in stock. Why not
run a special purchasing department? It looks
very much as if this business will some day run
into a great big mail order house, selling everything
and having a warehouse of its own. Hold
on, son&mdash;what’s the hurry?”</p>

<p>A bareheaded, wild-eyed youngster turning a
corner had bolted into Frank with considerable
force. Frank grabbed him quickly and swung to
a rebound poise, or both might have measured
their length on the walk.</p>

<p>“The very&mdash;fellow I&mdash;was after!” panted
the urchin in a gasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“That so?” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes. Say, the fellows all like you.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad. Thanks,” smiled Frank.</p>

<p>“And sent me&mdash;to hunt you&mdash;and come
back.”</p>

<p>“Back where, son?”</p>

<p>“Office&mdash;mail order house. Riot!”</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean?” inquired Frank,
quickening his steps.</p>

<p>“Big fellow from the country. Been drinking.
Smashed one of your windows. Went away.
Came back and smashed in the door. Says he’ll
wreck the place.”</p>

<p>“Why, what for?” demanded Frank, now
walking still faster.</p>

<p>“Says he’s a customer of yours. Says you
swindled him. Says he’ll wipe you out. That’s
it&mdash;run.”</p>

<p>Frank was not only puzzled, but quite startled.
He broke into a run. As he turned into the street
where the office was located, he heard a mingled
chorus of yells and cries.</p>

<p>A crowd made up mostly of boys filled the lawn
space in front of the office. A glance showed to
Frank the lower sash of the big front window in
ruins.</p>

<p>The showcase outside lay tipped over on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
ground. The office door, with an upper panel
slivered, hung on one hinge. From inside the
place there came slamming, crashing sounds.</p>

<p>Frank realized that something serious was happening.
He could not imagine what it could be.
He was not the boy, however, to remain inactive
while a wanton destruction of the little personal
property he owned was going on.</p>

<p>“Here he is!” cried an eager voice.</p>

<p>“Say, Newton, don’t go in there. The man’s
wild, crazy. He’ll half kill you.”</p>

<p>“We shall see about that,” retorted Frank,
grimly.</p>

<p>He parted the excited crowd and sprang past the
threshold of the dismantled door. His eyes
flashed as he took a glance about the place.</p>

<p>A waste basket had been kicked to the other
side of the room, littering the place from end to
end. A file cabinet had been upset against his
desk. Packages of circulars ready for the mail
had been hurled pell-mell against a partition.</p>

<p>The author of all this reckless riot was just now
pulling at some temporary shelves crossing a corner
of the room, holding boxes of envelopes. All
came down with a crash as Frank shouted sternly:</p>

<p>“Stop that&mdash;what are you doing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Huh!” growled the worker of all this mischief.
“I’m cleaning out this place.”</p>

<p>He was a husky, big-boned farmer-looking man
of middle age.</p>

<p>Frank saw that he had a wicked eye. He also
discerned that the fellow had been drinking heavily.</p>

<p>The stranger put his foot across a wicker basket
and crushed it to splinters.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what you got to say about it,” he
demanded, facing on Frank.</p>

<p>The big mailing table stood between them. The
fellow leaned upon it as he stared insolently and
savagely at Frank.</p>

<p>“I happen to be the proprietor of this place,” remarked
Frank.</p>

<p>“Whoop! you are?” yelled the man in a sort of
frantic joy. “You’re the mail order shark, are
you? Here’s luck. Better than smashing your
traps. Say, I’m going to eat you!”</p>

<p>The man made a pounce around the table to
catch Frank. His big fists warned the latter.
The fellow in his present condition was positively
dangerous, and was four times as big and strong as
Frank.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” cried Frank, seeking to temporize,
but still keeping his distance by following the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and keeping its broad surface between them.
“What do you mean by this riot and destruction?”</p>

<p>“Let me get you once, oh, let me just get my
hands on you once,” grated out the man, with a
savage crunching of his teeth, “and I’ll tell you all
about it. Won’t come to time, eh? Then&mdash;I’ll
come to you!”</p>

<p>Now excited, alarmed boyish faces peered in at
the door and window.</p>

<p>“Run for it, Newton,” advised a quick voice.</p>

<p>“Call the police&mdash;there’ll be murder done here
soon,” gasped another voice.</p>

<p>The stranger had sprung to the top of the table,
poised to next spring upon Frank and put a stop to
his retreating tactics.</p>

<p>He staggered as he tried to hold his footing.
Frank acted quickly.</p>

<p>Jumping to the farther end of the table he seized
its edge, gave it a lift and sent the troublesome intruder
sliding off his balance on a sharp slant.</p>

<p>Crash! the fellow struck the half-shattered front
window and went through it headlong.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>TROUBLE BREWING</small></h2>


<p>Frank was astonished at the ease and rapidity
with which he had dumped his troublesome visitor
clear out of the office.</p>

<p>“Good for you Newton!” hailed an approving
chorus of voices.</p>

<p>“Look out for him!”</p>

<p>“No, he’s got all he wants.”</p>

<p>Frank parted the excited ring surrounding the
ejected visitor. There lay the big, brawny fellow,
quiet enough now.</p>

<p>“He’s dead,” pronounced one awesome voice.</p>

<p>“No, only stunned,” dissented a second speaker.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the case,” said Frank.</p>

<p>In falling the man had struck a row of white
boulders edging a flower bed. There was quite
a contusion near one temple and he was bleeding at
the nose.</p>

<p>“The man’s hurt,” said Frank. “Some of you
help me lift him onto the grass, some one go for
a doctor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“No need,” sharply spoke a bystander&mdash;“here’s
the police.”</p>

<p>“Make way there, what’s the rumpus here, anyhow?”
challenged a stentorian voice.</p>

<p>Frank felt relieved. The speaker was the town
marshal. The gathering had been reported to him
and he had hurried to the spot.</p>

<p>The marshal dispersed the crowd. Two assistants
brought a litter and marched off with the insensible
man upon it. Frank closed the office door
and barricaded the window as best he could.</p>

<p>Then he accompanied the marshal to the town
lock-up. The prisoner was taken to a cell and a
physician was called. By and by the marshal came
back to Frank. He had a wallet, pocket knife and
other little articles in his hand.</p>

<p>“Only stunned, the rest of it is what he’s drank,”
he explained. “No need of worrying, Newton.
He’s got over two hundred dollars in this pocketbook,
so we’ll make him meet your bill of damages.
What will it be?”</p>

<p>“Oh, from ten to twenty-five dollars.”</p>

<p>Bob Haven had heard of the trouble and soon
joined Frank, and helped him to get things back
into order. A carpenter was called on to repair
window and door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sort of queer&mdash;the fellow making a break on
you this way,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“It mystifies me,” confessed Frank.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose he could be one of your
old apple-corer customers, do you?” inquired
Bob.</p>

<p>“Hardly. He acted like a man having some
solid grievance. Here’s the marshal coming. He
may have some inkling of the fellow’s motive.”</p>

<p>The marshal looked quite grave as he came
down the walk and beckoned Frank out of the office.</p>

<p>“That man’s name is Halsey,” he said “and he
comes from Westboro. Newton, he makes some
pretty serious charges against you. Says he has
been badly swindled.”</p>

<p>“Not by me,” declared Frank. “There must
be some mistake.”</p>

<p>“He says not. He claims he sent some money to
you and got a worthless article in return.”</p>

<p>“Let me see the man at once,” urged Frank.
“His charge is utterly unfounded. I am not in
business to defraud people, but to make regular
customers of them.”</p>

<p>“We all know that, Newton,” said the marshal
in a kindly tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank readily accompanied the marshal. When
they reached the police station he was taken down
stairs into the lock-up.</p>

<p>“Hi, let me out of here, will you?” demanded
his recent visitor, noisily jangling the door of his
cell.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, you,” ordered the marshal.
“Here’s the young man who runs the mail order
business here in Pleasantville.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is it,” cried the prisoner, with a savage
stare at Frank. “Let me out, officer. I want
about two minutes chance at the miserable swindler.”</p>

<p>“It will pay you to act with some reason,”
warned the marshal. “Now then, you made the
charge to me that you had been swindled.”</p>

<p>“Outrageously,” cried the prisoner.</p>

<p>“Give us the details. Young Newton has the
confidence of everybody in Pleasantville, and we
don’t believe he would do a dishonest act.”</p>

<p>“Don’t?” flared up the prisoner. “Why, I’ve
got the proofs. I got a circular a few days ago,
saying that I had been selected as the man in Westboro
to receive a full-size hunting-case watch and
chain, cut shown, for eleven dollars, provided I
would show it to my neighbors and advise them to
buy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never sent out such a circular,” asserted
Frank.</p>

<p>“I sent the money. The watch came yesterday
evening. It was a five-cent toy watch, tin cases,
paper face, no works.”</p>

<p>“Where is the circular you speak of?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“I left it at home. It was from the United
States Mail Order House, Pleasantville&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh,” interrupted Frank with sudden enlightenment.
Then, turning to the marshal, he added:
“This man probably tells the strict truth, but my
business advertises only as ‘Frank’s Mail Order
House.’”</p>

<p>“Then there’s two in Pleasantville?” demanded
the prisoner.</p>

<p>“I think so, yes,” answered Frank. “I shall
soon find out. At any rate, you have made a mistake
in charging me with this swindle. You have
damaged my office, and you must pay for it.”</p>

<p>“Son,” eagerly ejaculated the prisoner, pressing
his face close to the iron bars of his cell door, “you
find me the right swindler, and give me a brief
interview with him, and I’ll pay your bill twice
over.”</p>

<p>“We’ll let you know in a little time,” said the
marshal, moving off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now for the United States Mail Order
House,” said Frank to himself, as he left the village
lock-up. “Of course that means&mdash;Dale
Wacker.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>MYSTERIOUS STET</small></h2>


<p>Main Street Block was the oldest business
building in Pleasantville. It was here, according
to Stet’s brief report, that Dale Wacker had gone
into the mail order business.</p>

<p>Frank attended to some necessary writing at
the office. Then he went to Main Street Block.
Downstairs the street floor of the building was occupied
by stores that did a good trade. The upper
floors, however, were only partly occupied.</p>

<p>Frank went up the dusty stairs to the second
story. Here were a photographer, a surveyor, and
a tailor.</p>

<p>Frank ascended the last flight of stairs. When
he arrived at their top he found a small hallway
ending at a door.</p>

<p>“Why,” he said, “this floor is not divided off
into offices. Looks as if it had been used for a
lodge room. Yes, there is a peep-hole in that door.
I’ll knock, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Frank did knock. He heard some fumbling at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
a dirt-grimed window at one side of the hall. It
moved slightly in as if set on hinges.</p>

<p>Then there was dead silence. Again he hammered
at the door. A slight snap suddenly
sounded. This was caused by the cover to the little
circular hole in being shot back.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” sharply demanded the
voice of some one behind the hole, invisible for the
darkness of the closed in room or entry beyond.</p>

<p>“Is this the United States Mail Order House?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p>“The what?”</p>

<p>Frank repeated the magnificent-sounding name.</p>

<p>“Never heard of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, is there a Mr. Wacker here?”
persisted Frank.</p>

<p>“No. Nobody but a sick old man. Go away.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” said Frank, but the wicket went
shut with a sudden snap.</p>

<p>“Of course this is the place,” thought Frank.
“That’s something to know. Hello&mdash;”</p>

<p>Five steps down the stairs Frank started. Something
had struck his shoulder. As he turned he
noticed the window being pulled to. Also at his
feet the object that had struck him.</p>

<p>It was a little piece of tin&mdash;around it was tied
a fragment of coarse manilla paper. Frank picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
it up. He slipped it into his pocket and descended
to the street. Turning the corner he untied the
paper. It was scrawled over, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Keep cool. Be shady. Things working.
Important. Midnight.”</p></div>

<p>Frank had to smile at all this serio-tragic phraseology.</p>

<p>“Stet wrote that,” he said. “Still the dark and
mysterious detective! Probably enjoying it. He
usually means something though, for all his extravagant
ways of mystery. That means he has news
to tell me. But where does he expect to see me at
midnight? And why midnight?</p>

<p>“Ah! Brr-rr-r! Hist! Good old Stet!
He’ll probably do something sensational soon, but
meantime I must pursue my investigations.”</p>

<p>These did not result in much. Frank went to
the post-office. The postmaster told him that twice
a day either Dale Wacker or an old man who was
evidently associated with him brought a great many
letters to mail. In return they received as many as
forty letters a day. They presented a good many
money orders, always for the same amount&mdash;eleven
dollars.</p>

<p>The afternoon was nearly gone by this time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Frank called at the town hall but found that the
marshal had gone home to sleep until midnight.</p>

<p>“I will see him bright and early in the morning,”
decided Frank. “He can’t make any mistake by
assuming that old lodge room to be the headquarters
of the United States Mail Order House Swindle.
Those fellows are taking some risks. They
will be in for a sudden disappearance unless the
marshal nabs them soon.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to take a day or two looking
up Markham?” his mother asked at the tea table.</p>

<p>“I can’t to-morrow, mother,” continued Frank&mdash;“other
important business. I hope to get the
day following, though.”</p>

<p>Frank put in an hour on a small set of books he
kept at home covering the mail order business.
Then he went to bed.</p>

<p>Something disturbed him about two hours later,
for, almost wide awake, he counted the strokes of
the town bell. It was just twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>“Midnight, eh?” mused Frank. “That was
Stet’s dark and deadly hour. I say&mdash;if it isn’t
Stet on hand!”</p>

<p>Some pebbles struck the upper closed sash of the
room in which Frank slept. Beyond the wire
screen covering the lower half of the window
Frank made out a form moving to and fro.</p>

<p>“Hist!” sounded out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Stet,” said Frank, slipping out of bed, “I
hear you. Well?”</p>

<p>“It’s me,” said Stet. “Lift up the screen, will
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, want to come in!”</p>

<p>“I don’t, but I do want to give you something.”</p>

<p>“Why, what is this?” asked Frank, as lifting
the screen Stet shoved a round package into his
hand.</p>

<p>“It’s your missing mailing lists.”</p>

<p>“And where did you get them?”</p>

<p>“Dale Wacker has been using them ever since
he started in business,” explained Stet. “Where
he got them is easy to guess.”</p>

<p>“From Markham, of course.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. This was my first chance to get
away from them. Say, there’s Wacker and his
partner. They’re up to the worst swindle you ever
heard of. They’ve taken in a big lot of money.
They’re booked to leave to-morrow, so I sneaked
the lists out of the outfit. I’m not going back to
them.”</p>

<p>“Why, then&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m going down to Hazelhurst,” proceeded
Stet.</p>

<p>Frank was surprised that Stet should mention
the very place he had most in his mind.</p>

<p>“To Hazelhurst?” he repeated curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. From something I heard Wacker say
to his partner, I am pretty sure that Wacker has
got Markham hidden away or a prisoner somewhere
around Hazelhurst.”</p>

<p>“Why, Stet,” said Frank, “I have thought that,
too. I was going there myself to-morrow, only
some important business hinders me.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what I’ll do,” suggested Stet; “let
me see what I can find at Hazelhurst. There’s
going to be a big blow-up with Wacker &amp; Co. to-morrow.
As I have sort of been in with them,
maybe it would be best for me to keep out of the
way so I won’t get hit with any of the pieces.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by a blow up, Stet?” inquired
Frank.</p>

<p>“’Splosion.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing! Say about ten o’clock to-morrow
morning you hang around Main Street Block, and
see what a telegram I sent to-day is going to fetch
the United States Mail Order House.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>THE POST-OFFICE INSPECTOR</small></h2>


<p>“Now then, my friend, behave yourself.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I paid the damages?”</p>

<p>“You have, but don’t get into any further expensive
mischief.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” observed the victim of Dale Wacker’s
mail order swindle, “that’s to be seen, if I ever
get my hands on the real fellow who robbed me.
As to you, stranger,” to Frank, “just send in your
bill double. Sorry I disturbed you, but we all make
mistakes.”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Halsey,” replied Frank, “I only ask
you to pay the cost of that window you smashed
and the door you broke.”</p>

<p>“How much&mdash;let me settle it now,” urged
Halsey.</p>

<p>“I’ll trust you,” said Frank. “I will send the
bill when the carpenter gets the repairs done.”</p>

<p>The trial had come off. A small fine had been
imposed by the village judge on Halsey for his
disorderly conduct. The marshal had explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to him that Frank was not the person who had
swindled him. He added that very probably
through Frank’s investigation they would soon discover
the identity of the United States Mail Order
House.</p>

<p>“You can come with us, but you will have to
curb your fighting proclivities,” warned the marshal.
“Here is where the law steps in, and you
must not interfere with its course.”</p>

<p>“I came a long way to get satisfaction,” muttered
Halsey. “Somehow, I’ll have it too.”</p>

<p>The marshal led the way, and they were soon
mounting the stairs of Main Street Block. They
proceeded quietly, so as to give no warning or create
any curiosity with other occupants of the building.</p>

<p>“There is the door,” said Frank in a guarded
tone, as they reached the landing of the third
story.</p>

<p>The marshal advanced and gave a firm resounding
knock on its panels. They could detect a stir
within. Then the wicket shot back.</p>

<p>“Who are you&mdash;what do you want? Thunder!
it’s the marshal.”</p>

<p>Frank fancied he recognized the tones as belonging
to Dale Wacker.</p>

<p>“That’s who it is,” answered the official. “Here,
here I want a word with you, young man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>The wicket was shot as suddenly as it had been
opened. They could hear a quick scramble in the
room beyond.</p>

<p>“Open this door,” loudly demanded the marshal,
resuming his knocking.</p>

<p>“They won’t do it,” spoke up Halsey, advancing
a step. “Say,” lifting his ponderous fist, “I’ll
soon clear the way, if you say the word.”</p>

<p>“No,” responded the marshal, putting up a detaining
hand. “We have no legal right to invade
the premises. Whoever is in there, cannot escape.
There is no other stairway leading to the street except
this one.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Why, you had better go back to the town hall
with Halsey,” advised the officer. “See the clerk,
and let Halsey swear out a criminal warrant against
Dale Wacker and others concerned in a swindling
scheme at this place.”</p>

<p>“All right,” nodded Frank. “Come Mr.
Halsey, let us make haste.”</p>

<p>“I will save you any delay, gentlemen,” spoke
up a new voice.</p>

<p>All three turned, to observe a keen-faced, bright-eyed
man who had come quickly up the stairs.
There was a certain half-military, half-official precision
to his make up that at once impressed Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” continued the newcomer, coming forward
on the landing as though he had a perfect
right there, “I’ll soon get action here. You are
the town marshal, I believe?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” nodded the officer, regarding
the speaker in some wonderment.</p>

<p>“Well, I am a post-office inspector. Came on a
telegram. Got the birds caged in there? Give
me a few facts, will you?”</p>

<p>The marshal briefly recited his suspicions and the
case of Halsey. The inspector as tersely told of a
telegram the post-office department had received,
exposing the operations of the United States Mail
Order House. Frank at once decided that Stet was
its author.</p>

<p>“No dilatory fraud order case here,” observed
the inspector briskly. “It’s got to be a raid, I
see. Here, let me have a try. In there!” called
out the official in a loud tone of voice, pounding on
the door panels, “open in the name of the law, or we
shall be obliged to use force.”</p>

<p>There was no response whatever to this mandatory
challenge. The inspector placed his ear to the
door. Then he said sharply.</p>

<p>“Watch out close. I will be back at once.”</p>

<p>“He’s brought the locksmith with him,” announced
the marshal a few minutes later, peering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
over the banisters. “Those government fellows
act pretty swiftly when they make up their minds.
We haven’t the power that they have.”</p>

<p>The inspector, arrived with the locksmith, ordered
the latter to open the door.</p>

<p>Frank looked about him curiously as, the door
once opened, all hands passed into the room beyond.
Its tables were littered with envelopes, circulars
and letters.</p>

<p>The big lodge chamber was partitioned off at
one end by a cambric curtain. Here there was a
couch, a small oil stove and some eatables and
dishes, evidences of light housekeeping on the
premises.</p>

<p>The inspector darted about from corner to corner,
and into all the little apartments that had
formerly been in service as lodge and rooms.</p>

<p>“H’m,” he observed, coming back from his inspection
to the others, “birds have flown.”</p>

<p>He moved to an open window. Pendant from
an iron shutter hinge was a strong portable knotted
fire escape. Its ground end trailed into an inside
court of the building.</p>

<p>“If you think you know the people who were
here and who have certainly escaped,” suggested
the inspector to the marshal, “you had better get
your men on their track before they leave town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” said the marshal glumly making
for the door.</p>

<p>“Here, I’m in on that arrangement,” observed
Halsey.</p>

<p>The inspector with an eagle glance at the letters
on the tables and a business-like air, sat down
to look over a mass of correspondence lying before
him. Frank went up to him.</p>

<p>“Can I be of any assistance to you, sir?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“You helped in this thing. Yes, yes you can
help me,” said the inspector. “Take this note to
the local postmaster, will you?”</p>

<p>The inspector wrote a few words on his own
card. It summoned the postmaster. The inspector
directed that official to deliver all future
mail of the Wacker outfit to himself or his representative.</p>

<p>When the postmaster was gone the inspector
impressed Frank into service. This consisted in
sorting out the letters and taking down the names
of the persons who had been swindled.</p>

<p>“Now you can go for the marshal, if you will,”
said the inspector, about an hour later.</p>

<p>Frank found that official just returned from an
unsuccessful search for Dale Wacker and the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
man with the big beard, his presumable partner,
whom Stet had vaguely described to Frank.</p>

<p>“I must catch the afternoon train for the city
and make my report to headquarters,” said the
inspector, when Frank returned to him with the
marshal. “I want you to put a trustworthy custodian
in charge here until we can send a regular
man to close up the matter, and start after those
swindlers.”</p>

<p>“I’ll put one of my deputies in charge,” said
the marshal. “As to Wacker and his partner,
they’re probably safe and far by this time.”</p>

<p>The inspector regarded the speaker with a half-pitying,
half-contemptuous look.</p>

<p>“That’s as may be,” he observed, “for the present.
We don’t let matters drop that easily, ourselves.
There’s something you mustn’t forget officer:
When the United States Government gets
after a guilty man, if he fled to the furthest corners
of the earth, we never let up till we find him.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>A HEART OF GOLD</small></h2>


<p>It had been a strenuous day for Frank. He and
his mother had put in double duty at the office
that afternoon. Everything in the mail order business
was moving along smoothly. Only this complication
of Dale Wacker and Markham comprised
a disturbing, unsettled element in the situation.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful moonlight night. Frank enjoyed
the quiet of the hour after the stirring turmoil
of the day, and prolonged his stroll. Almost
instinctively his footsteps led him in the direction
of the scene of the main commotion of the day&mdash;Main
Street Block.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Frank suddenly and in some surprise,
as, passing its gloomy entrance, he observed
a solitary figure seated on a step in its shadow.</p>

<p>Frank recognized the man whom the marshal
had appointed as custodian of the raided mail order
concern up-stairs.</p>

<p>“Oh, that you, Newton?” spoke the man in a
somewhat embarrassed way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Frank, “just headed for bed.
Enjoying the fine evening?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the custodian slowly, “I can’t say
I am. Sort of lonely. Don’t be in a rush. Dull
and sleepy hanging around this desolate old barracks.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go to bed, then?” suggested
Frank. “There’s a comfortable cot upstairs
there.”</p>

<p>“Ugh,” responded the custodian, with a grim
shudder&mdash;“catch me!”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?” pressed Frank, discerning
that something really was wrong.</p>

<p>“I believe the place is haunted. I have heard
some awful groans.”</p>

<p>Frank was interested, and finally said he would
go with the watchman and make an investigation.
For quarter of an hour they found nothing, then
Frank discovered the form of a man lying in the
bottom of a disused coal chute. The man was in
great pain. Much to the youth’s amazement the
fellow proved to be Gideon Purnell.</p>

<p>Frank questioned the rascal and found out Purnell
had been Wacker’s partner in the dishonest
mail order scheme. Purnell had fallen down the
chute while trying to escape from the marshal.
His back was injured and the fellow was in a dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
condition. He begged Frank to take him to
some place where he could die in peace.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for you,” said Frank. “If you
really are badly hurt&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t doubt it. I know what I’m talking
about,” said Purnell. “I’ve only a few days left.”</p>

<p>“I want to do right,” said Frank slowly.</p>

<p>“Then help a poor, broken wretch to die in
peace,” pleaded Purnell.</p>

<p>“I’ll be back soon,” said Frank simply, deeply
affected himself.</p>

<p>Frank acted on an impulse he could hardly control.
He ran to the Haven home and roused up
Darry and Bob. There was animated explanation
and discussion.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later, secret and stealthy as midnight
marauders, the trio of friends wheeled the
Haven Brothers’ delivery hand cart down the alley
behind Main Street Block.</p>

<p>“Bet the fellow played you&mdash;bet he’s made
off,” predicted Bob.</p>

<p>However, they found Purnell just where Frank
had left him, only insensible now. They lifted
him, a dead weight, into the cart. Then Bob,
piloting the way, warned Frank and Darry of late
pedestrians, and thus they reached Frank’s home.</p>

<p>“Where am I&mdash;in a hospital?” spoke Purnell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
weakly, arousing from his stupor an hour later.</p>

<p>“You are at my home,” said Frank, coming to
the side of the comfortable bed where the sufferer
lay.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! no!” panted Purnell. “Let me hide
my head with shame&mdash;let me die. In your home&mdash;under
the roof of the people I ruined&mdash;robbed!
Heaven have pity on me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t think about that,” said Frank soothingly.
“We have tried to make you comfortable.
In the morning we will get a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Not a doctor, boy, no, but a lawyer,” spoke
Purnell in broken tones. “Boy, the meanest thing
I ever did was to rob your mother of her fortune.
Let the last thing I can do on earth be to give it
back to her.”</p>

<p>Frank remained by the side of the sufferer until
early morning. Then Bob Haven came with a
telegram from Stet.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Markham is found!” cried Frank,
reading the message. “Stet found him in a coal
mine. He was a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Good for Stet!” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Just what I say. Markham is coming here.
Bob, the skies are clearing, it would seem.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of it, Frank.”</p>

<p>The news about Markham was indeed true. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
had been kept a prisoner in an abandoned mine by
an old man who was a tool of Wacker. The old
man had been well-thrashed by Stet and had fled
to parts unknown. Markham had quite a story
to tell, as we shall soon see.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>There was no regret with Frank for the kindness
he had shown Gideon Purnell. That man had
died three days after Frank had removed him to
the little cottage, leaving a signed confession that
meant the defeat of Dorsett in his suit at law.</p>

<p>Markham referred to the matter of his disappearance,
but in a vague, constrained way.</p>

<p>He stated that Dale Wacker had a certain
power to do him great harm. So great was his
dread, that he had consented to accompany
Wacker away from the town. He had managed,
however, first to drop the two hundred dollars
where it was later recovered by Frank.</p>

<p>“Never mind what it was,” explained Markham,
“but that boy could do me great harm. I
hoped to temporize with him. He took me to a
lonely farmhouse. Here he had a friend as bad
as himself. They locked me up, took the mailing
lists away from me, and said I should never go
free till I told what I had done with your money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
which, somehow, Wacker knew I had in my possession
when he first overtook me. It was at the
farmhouse that I made up that letter to Haven
Brothers. I dropped it next day from a wagon
in which they drove me to the mine.”</p>

<p>“All right, Markham,” said Frank, “there’s
more to tell I know, but you’ll tell me when the
right time comes, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“The right time will soon be here, never fear,”
declared Markham, with emotion. “I have written
a letter that will bring me a friend who will
quickly clear up all this mystery.”</p>

<p>The old office had been cut up into four rooms.
A young lady kept the books. Frank had engaged
a crippled young man as a stenographer,
and he was a good one. Markham and himself
had each an office to himself. Upstairs was the
stock and shipping rooms employing four boys.</p>

<p>“System and sense” had been Frank’s watchwords&mdash;the
mail order business was a pronounced
success on that basis.</p>

<p>“A gentleman to see you,” spoke the stenographer,
arousing Frank from a most pleasing day
dream.</p>

<p>Frank looked up to greet a bronzed, earnest-eyed
man of middle age. He was erect and military
in his bearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is a young man named Markham employed
here?” inquired the stranger.</p>

<p>“He is interested in the business here, yes,”
said Frank.</p>

<p>This would have been news to Markham himself.
The wire puzzle had brought in lots of
money. Frank had planned to tell Markham that
very evening that the latter should have a settled,
tangible interest in the mail order business.</p>

<p>“I did not know that,” said the visitor, with a
quick sparkle in his eyes that Frank could not at
all understand. “I very much wish to see him.”</p>

<p>“He is away on some business,” explained
Frank, “but I think he will return within an
hour.”</p>

<p>“May I wait?” politely inquired the gentleman.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Frank, “just step into his office.”</p>

<p>Frank ushered the stranger into the next office,
pulled a chair near the window, and handed him
the daily paper from the city.</p>

<p>He resumed his work. Engrossed in this, he
almost forgot about the waiting stranger. Frank
finally discovered that over an hour had gone by.
He stepped to the door of the adjoining office.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for your long wait, sir,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
“but I feel certain Markham will be here soon.
Is it anything I can attend to for him?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the definite reply.</p>

<p>Just then Frank heard some one inquiring for
him in the outer office. This seemed to be a day
for strangers. Two men whom he had never seen
before entered his room.</p>

<p>One free and easy of manner at once addressed
Frank.</p>

<p>“Is your name Newton?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Frank, none too well pleased
at the man’s familiarity.</p>

<p>“Believe you telegraphed to the reformatory
at Linwood some time since about a boy named
Welmore&mdash;Richard Markham Welmore?”</p>

<p>Frank started. He was greatly taken aback.</p>

<p>“Did I?” he said simply.</p>

<p>“You did,” asserted the stranger promptly.
“You’ve given us some trouble running you down.
Welmore, under the name of Markham, is now
in your employ.”</p>

<p>“What of it?” inquired Frank, with dire forebodings
of trouble.</p>

<p>“We want him, that’s all, my dear young
friend,” broke in the other man. “Dangerous
character, escaped criminal. This is an officer of
the institution.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is your interest in this matter, may I
ask?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p>“Distant relative, guardian, best friend. Sad
case. Left on my hands, cared for him, spent my
means educating him. Repaid kindness by robbing
me.”</p>

<p>“That is a falsehood!”</p>

<p>Like a thunder clap the words sounded out.
The waiting stranger in the next room spoke them.
As he appeared in the open doorway, the man
whose veracity he challenged looked as though
confronted by an accusing nemesis.</p>

<p>“Welmore!” he almost screamed. He turned
white as a sheet and cowered back.</p>

<p>“Yes, Jasper Lane&mdash;false friend, perjurer
and thief,” flashed out the other. “You cared
for Dick Welmore? You expended your means
on him? Where is the two thousand dollars I
left you for his education?”</p>

<p>“Keep him off&mdash;don’t let him touch me,”
pleaded the other man.</p>

<p>“Pah!” coarsely uttered the reformatory man,
giving Lane a disgusted push to one side. “Mister,”
he continued, addressing Lane’s accuser, “if
there’s been crooked business here, we didn’t
know it.”</p>

<p>“There has been,” affirmed the other. “My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
boy wrote me about it. I have hastened from the
Philippines to right his wrongs. This creature,
Lane, accused him falsely, had him imprisoned.
I secured the proofs of it before I came here to
find my son Dick Welmore.”</p>

<p>“Markham’s father!” murmured Frank.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the officer, “your boy will have
to go with me, but if you can prove what you
say, the court will not long hold him.”</p>

<p>“You, Jasper Lane,” spoke Mr. Welmore
sternly, “you do not leave my side till you have
righted my boy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, I’ll do it! Don’t expose me, don’t
ruin my reputation!” whined Jasper Lane.</p>

<p>“There is Markham&mdash;Dick&mdash;now,” announced
Frank, as a cheery whistle sounded outside.</p>

<p>The next moment Markham entered the room,
grew pale as he first noticed Lane, saw his father,
and flew to his parent’s arms with a wild cry of
delight.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said, leading Mr. Welmore
towards Frank, “this is Frank Newton, the best
friend I ever had in the world.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Seen your sign outside&mdash;Boy Wanted&mdash;I
need a job.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, in a moment. Sit down.”</p>

<p>Frank did not look up from the letter he was
reading to give attention to the applicant for
work.</p>

<p>It was a very interesting letter for Frank, for it
was from Dick Welmore, or Markham, as we
have known him.</p>

<p>It told that the youth had been completely vindicated
and released, and would be back at his
business post of duty in the morning.</p>

<p>It also enclosed an item cut from a city paper,
telling of the arrest and conviction of Dale
Wacker for robbing street mail boxes.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Frank now, for the first moment
glancing at the boy he had requested to be
seated. “Want work, do you&mdash;Why, Nelson
Cady!”</p>

<p>“It’s me, yes,” confessed Frank’s visitor.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Frank, “I thought you were in
Idaho?”</p>

<p>“Was&mdash;ain’t now. Never will be again,” declared
Nelson.</p>

<p>“And you have come back to try something
more congenial, Nelson?” insinuated Frank, with
a friendly smile.</p>

<p>“Yes. I want work. Give it to me, will you?”
pleaded Nelson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you been home yet?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“No, nor won’t go there until I have earned
enough to pay back the money my father started
me out with.”</p>

<p>“I’ll hire you, Nelson,” said Frank readily,
“only I must advise your father where you are.”</p>

<p>The result of his decision to put aside roaming
and adventure for practical business will be told
in another volume, to be entitled “The Young
Storekeeper.” In that volume we shall meet Frank
and some of our other friends again.</p>

<p>The following week Frank found that the business
needed more space, and closed an advantageous
lease for the third floor of Main Street
Block.</p>

<p>Right in the heart of the bustling little town,
one morning, a big gilt sign announced to the public
the new and enlarged quarters of <span class="smcap">Frank’s
Mail Order House</span>.</p>
